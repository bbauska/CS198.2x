<h3 id="table-of-contents">Course Syllabus: CS198.2x Blockchain</h3>
<p>This course provides a wide overview of many of the topics relating to and 
building upon the foundation of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.</p>

<p>The course is divided into 6 modules: 1. Distributed Systems &amp; Consensus, 
2. Cryptoeconomics &amp; Proof-of-Stake, 3. Enterprise Blockchain, 4. Scalability, 
5. Anonymity, and 6. A Blockchain Powered Future.</p>

<h2><a href="#ch1">1. Trust Without Trust: <i>Distributed Systems &amp; Consensus</i></a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of computer 
  science and distributed systems literature. We start out by providing a formal 
  definition of distributed consensus and presenting foundational theoretical 
  computer science topics such as the CAP Theorem and the Byzantine Generals 
  Problem. We then explore alternative consensus mechanisms to Bitcoin’s 
  Proof-of-work, including Proof-of-Stake, voting-based consensus algorithms, 
  and federated consensus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="#ch2">2. Securing Incentives: <i>Cryptoeconomics &amp;Proof-of-Stake</i></a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We examine the meaning and properties of cryptoeconomics as it relates to 
  its two compositional fields: cryptography and economics. We then look at the 
  goals of cryptoeconomics with respect to distributed systems fundamentals 
  (liveness, safety, data availability) and the griefing factors and faults in 
  the way of these goals.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="#ch3">3. Real-World Applications: <i>Enterprise Blockchain</i></a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We categorize the uses of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, 
  and look at various existing enterprise-level blockchain implementations, 
  such as JP Morgan’s Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and HyperLedger. We also 
  explore business and industry use cases for blockchain, ICOs, and the 
  increasing regulations surrounding blockchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="#ch4">4. Cryptocurrencies for the Masses: <i>Scaling Blockchain</i></a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>One major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of 
  scalability. We define scaling first as it relates to Bitcoin as a payment 
  method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment such as credit 
  cards. We then consider the general blockchain scalability debate and look 
  into some solutions categorized by vertical and horizontal, as well as layer 
  1 and layer 2 scaling. Topics include block size increases, Segregated Witness, 
  payment channels, Lightning Network, sidechains, Plasma, sharding, and Cosmos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="#ch5">5. The Fight for Privacy: <i>Anonymity, Mixing &amp; Altcoins</i></a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We look into the measures that governments have taken to regulate and 
  control blockchain technology.  We examine Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and 
  Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, anonymity goals, and government 
  techniques for deanonymization of entities on blockchain. Then from the 
  user’s perspective, we also dive into privacy oriented altcoins and mixing 
  techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="#ch6">6. A Blockchain Powered Future</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A summary of the entire Blockchain Fundamentals program and an exploratory 
  look into blockchain ventures today, such as venture capitalism, ICOs, and 
  crowdfunding. We conclude with a blockchain-based future thought experiment 
  and explain the avenues for the student’s potential involvement.</p>

<h4 id="notes">Notes from Rustie</h4>

<p>Since Fall, 2016, Blockchain at Berkeley has been offering a course
on the fundamental concepts of cryptocurrencies and blockchain on UC
Berkeley campus. The goal was to create a survey of the blockchain space
that was accessible to anyone, no matter their background.</p>

<p>Our core curriculum, Blockchain Fundamentals, is split into two main
narrative “epochs,” which roughly model the gradual maturing and general
sentiment about cryptocurrency and then later blockchain technologies.
This has translated nicely to the edX platform.</p>

<p>Our narrative starts with <a
href="https://www.edx.org/course/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-and-the-crypto-space" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies</a> 
explaining cryptocurrencies as the first use case for blockchain, and Bitcoin 
as the original inspiration. Our aim for this first epoch is to explore both 
the technological and social aspects of Bitcoin, and then introduce Ethereum 
towards the end, so as to dramatically reveal to students the amount of 
intuition that carries over between understanding different blockchain 
platforms at a high level. While the name of the epoch is “Bitcoin and 
Cryptocurrencies,” the primary motivation outside of explaining what the title 
says is to decouple the ideas of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from that of
blockchain. </p>

<p>With the realization that their intuition carries from Bitcoin, a
cryptocurrency, to Ethereum, a more generalized blockchain platform,
students then transition into the curriculum’s second epoch, <a
href="https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-advancing-decentralized-technology" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockchain Technology </a> The aim for 
this second epoch is to further expand the student’s mental model of what blockchain 
is. At this point, students are confident in their understanding of cryptocurrencies 
and blockchain, so in this epoch, we start by diving into important big-picture
technical topics.</p>

<p>That’s where we are now, and we can’t wait to get to know each and
every one of you through the discussions you start and the questions you
ask. Our vision for Blockchain Fundamentals was to surmount the steep
learning curve of blockchain and to create a space for students of all
backgrounds to collaborate and learn together. If you have any questions
or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask in the discussion boards.</p>

<p>On behalf of all of our amazing course staff, I’d like to officially
welcome you to CS198.2x Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the course! </p>
<p>Rustie Lin</p>

<p>Blockchain Fundamentals started off as the <a
href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa16/" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptocurrency
DeCal </a>(Democratic Education at Cal, student run) course on UC
Berkeley campus in Fall 2016, taking inspiration from existing courses,
videos, and textbooks. From the beginning, the vision was to lower the
barrier of entry and provide a survey into the blockchain and
cryptocurrency space – to explain concepts from the ground up, as
clearly and concisely as possible.</p>

<p>Each semester since then, we have had many student volunteers take
time out of their already hectic schedules to help develop and fine-tune
content, to make Blockchain Fundamentals what it is today. </p>
<p>Blockchain Fundamentals is constantly being improved, in terms of new
information as well as course design, but its vision has remained
constant. Here are some of the major contributors to Blockchain
Fundamentals, who have not already been featured on the previous

<h4>FAQ</h4>

<p>Q: Are there any prerequisites to this course?</p>

<p>A: CS198.1x Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies (or equivalent knowledge) is
a prerequisite to this course. You can review all material from the
first course online for free or for a professional certificate.</p>
<p>Q: If this is a computer science course, why are there no programming
assignments?</p>

<p>A: There are many answers to this question. Firstly, computer science
is not programming, and especially for this course, we’re operating at a
higher level of thinking. We’ll be designing systems from the ground up
rather than being “stuck in the code.” Additionally, to keep the
material open and accessible to students of all backgrounds, we have
designed the course to focus on fundamental blockchain thinking. </p>

<p>It is, however, important to get your hands dirty and understand how
blockchain systems are actually built. If you are interested, we have a
separate curriculum, Blockchain for Developers, which we plan to port
over to edX in the near future. Recordings from our latest offering
(Spring 2018) can be found online for free at <a
href="https://learnblockcha.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Blockchain</a></p>

<p>Q: Who is Blockchain at Berkeley?</p>
<p>A: Blockchain at Berkeley is a student organization on the UC
Berkeley Campus, dedicated to serving the crypto and blockchain
communities. Our members include Berkeley students, alumni, community
members, and blockchain enthusiasts from all educational and industrial
backgrounds.</p>

<p>Welcome to the first module of Blockchain Technology, the second
course in the Blockchain Fundamentals program.</p>
<p>This course is a continuation of our first course, Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies; if you haven’t already, please take a look at that
course.</p>

<p>In the first course, we studied Bitcoin as the first use case for
blockchain and examined its various components and properties.</p>

<p>We also looked at how blockchain is used for cryptocurrencies and
generalized computational platforms, such as Ethereum.</p>

<p>By now, you’ve decoupled the concept of blockchain from
cryptocurrencies to understand all the pieces individually and how they
fit together.</p>

<p>This first week, we’ll be covering distributed systems and consensus
algorithms.</p>

<p>You should be familiar with Bitcoin, one of the largest
cryptocurrencies, and its use of Proof-of-Work to make sure everyone
agrees – or comes to consensus – on who owns what amounts of
bitcoin.</p>
	
<p>This is what Bitcoin accomplishes, but what is the underlying problem
that Bitcoin is trying to solve?</p>

<p>Well, it’s truly a distributed systems problem: several computers,
all unknown and untrusting of each other, are trying to agree on
something.</p>

<p>Understanding the fundamental purpose and challenges of building
distributed systems will give us the ability to understand the subset
that is blockchain.</p>

<p>First, we’ll go over distributed systems fundamentals and the
consensus problem, some tradeoffs and formalisms, and traditional
literature in the space.</p>

<p>Then, we’ll look at Nakamoto Consensus, a new paradigm of distributed
consensus, and examine how it fits into the traditional model of
distributed systems, with a focus on Proof-of-Stake and other new styles
of consensus.</p>

<p>After this lecture, you’ll be able to think about blockchain within
the much larger scope of distributed systems and consensus.</p>

<h4 id="ch1">>Week 1 Announcements</h4>

<p>Welcome to Week 1. Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect every
week:</p>

<p>In general, each week will have 5 sections of video content and
associated Quick Check questions. Quick Checks, as their name implies,
are designed to be quick self-tests that you indeed understand the
material. Quick Checks are graded on correctness, but you will have
unlimited tries on each Quick Check question.</p>
<p>The 1st week, we cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Distributed Systems</p></li>
  <li><p>Voting Based Consensus</p></li>
  <li><p>Nakamoto Consensus</p></li>
  <li><p>Proof-of-Stake</p></li>
  <li><p>Federated Consensus</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>1.1 Intro: Distributed Systems</h2>

<p>Let’s take a step back and think about the design and architecture of
what we’re trying to achieve with blockchain.</p>
<p>What exactly are we trying to build, and how do we go about designing
such a system?</p>
<p>With blockchain, we want to deploy it across a network, where users
who potentially are located on different sides of the world can interact
with one another.</p>
<p>We want this system to be distributed – a distributed system!</p>
<p>We want such a system to be able to agree on a common truth without
trusting a single machine or authority.</p>
<p>In other words, we need the network to be able to reach
consensus.</p>
<p>Instead of trusting the execution of individual processes or
reliability of any individuals, we trust the general protocol and the
math behind it.</p>
<p>It’s trust – without trust.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, distributed systems and the consensus problem have
been studied for decades by mathematicians and computer scientists.</p>
<p>It’s by studying this traditional literature and design formalisms
that we can start designing blockchain systems from the ground up.</p>

<h3>Distributed Systems Origins</h3>

<p>Before we explain what a distributed system actually is, let’s define
a fundamental, age-old problem that pervades not only computer science
and blockchain technology, but all of humanity.</p>
<p>How does a group make a decision?</p>
<p>Whether this be by majority opinion, general agreement, or force, how
do we each consensus?</p>
<p>Consensus is trivial when we only have one actor.</p>
<p>I can always agree with myself on where to have lunch, but when I go
out with my friends, we have to all agree on where to go first, and the
process by which we reach agreement might be difficult.</p>

   src="./images/image001a.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems Origins: Why Study Consensus?"
  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Why Study Consensus?" />

<p>In this example, my group of friends had to come to consensus on a
common choice of action – what to get for lunch – before we were able to
move forward – to actually get lunch.</p>
<p>This is no different from how a distributed system works, and is
where we start building our intuition and context.</p>

<img class="displayed"

  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems Origins: Digital Avionics"
  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Digital Avionics." />

<p>Consensus has been studied for ages in fields such as biophysics,
ethics, and philosophy, but the formal study of consensus in computer
science didn’t start until the 70s and 80s, when people decided that it
would be a good idea to put computers on airplanes.</p>
<p>The airline industry wanted computers to be able to assist in flying
and monitoring aircraft systems: this included monitoring altitude,
speed, and fuel, as well as processes such as fly-by-wire and autopilot
later on.</p>
<p>This was a huge challenge because being at such a high altitude poses
many threats to normal execution of computer programs.</p>
<p>For one, it’s a very adversarial environment.</p>
<p>Being so high up means that the atmosphere is thinner, increasing the
chance of a bit flip due to solar radiation.</p>
<p>And all it takes is a single bit flip to completely destroy the
normal execution of, for example, the sensor measuring the amount of
fuel an aircraft has left.</p>
<p>Compounded on this was the fact that aircraft could cost hundreds of
millions of US dollars, and that commercial airliners where these
computers were going to be deployed could carry hundreds of
passengers.</p>
<p>Super dependable computer systems were first pioneered by aircraft
manufacturers.</p>
<p>They realized that the problem they were solving could be solved by
introducing redundancy in their system.</p>
<p>Instead of using a single computer onboard their aircraft, thus
having a single point of failure, they used multiple computers onboard
to distribute the points of failure.</p>
<p>How these computers coordinated amongst each other though was another
challenge.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 03. distributed systems origins: early literature (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image003.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems Origins: Early Literature"
  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Early Literature." />

<p>Early literature had focused on enabling coordination of processes –
where these processes could be processes on a CPU, or computers in a
network, separated spatially.</p>
<p>One of the most impactful pieces of literature during this time was
“Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System”,
written by computer scientist and mathematician Leslie Lamport in the
late 70s.</p>
<p>In “Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed
System”, Lamport shows that two events occurring at separate physical
times can be concurrent, so long as they don’t affect one another.</p>
<p>Much of the paper is spent defining causality – what it means for an
event to happen before another – in both the logical and physical
sense.</p>
<p>This is important because determining the order of when events take
place, such as the measurement of a sensor or detection of error and
subsequent error correction – as well as determining which events
actually took place in the first place – is crucial to the correct
functioning of a distributed system.</p>
<p>On the right, you can see one of Lamport’s diagrams, depicting three
processes – the vertical lines – each with their own set of events – the
points on these lines.</p>
<p>Time flows in the upwards direction, and each squiggly line between
events represents a message being sent, and received at a later
time.</p>
<p>If there exists a path from one event to another, by only traveling
upwards in the diagram, then that means that one event happened before
the other.</p>
<p>If an event doesn’t happen either before or after another event, then
it’s said that those events are concurrent.</p>
<p>For those of you with experience in quantum physics, you may notice
the resemblance between Lamport’s diagrams, and Feynman diagrams, which
show the interaction of subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Lamport realized that the notion of causality in distributed systems
was analogous to that in special relativity.</p>
<p>In both, there are no notions of a total ordering of events – events
may appear to happen at different times to different observers, in the
case of relativity, or processes, in the case of distributed
systems.</p>
<p>While this is at a depth that is out of scope for this course, it’s
important to recognize that through the efforts of Lamport and other
scientists, the formal study of distributed systems began to take
shape.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image004.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems Origins: Other Problems"
  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Other Problems." />

<p>And as it turns out, the same problem that was originally studied to
coordinate computers on commercial airliners is still studied today, for
example on more high-tech jet planes.</p>

  style="width:45%;" />

<p>And more recently, on various spacecraft, such as SpaceX’s famous
Falcon 9 or Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>For example, spacecraft have to be tolerant of the violent vibrations
when accelerating through Earth’s atmosphere, and when they do leave the
atmosphere, they have to deal with intense heat and cold depending on
which side of Earth they’re on, and also solar radiation.</p>
SpaceX Dragon specifically uses three flight computers, which perform
calculations independently, and reboot automatically if errors are found
after cross checking.

  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Other Problems #3." />

<p>Distributed systems and consensus is also studied in the context of
big enterprise operations as well.</p>
<p>Distributed lock servers for example, ensure that no two processes
can read or write to the same piece of data at the same time – a problem
called mutual exclusion – thereby preventing potential corruption to
important data.</p>

  alt="Distributed Systems Origins: Other Problems #4." />

<p>And finally, of course – the main focus of this course – the
blockchain and distributed ledger revolution.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, each of these problems we just went over, and more,
reduce to the problem of consensus.</p>
<p>In aircraft like rockets, jet planes, and commercial airlines, a
number of redundant onboard computers must come to consensus on sensory
data for example – the position of the aircraft, its location and
altitude, as well as its fuel levels, etc..</p>
<p>In enterprise distributed lock servers, processes must come to
consensus on who can write what data at what time, as the coordination
of this prevents data loss and corruption.</p>
<p>And finally, in blockchain, full nodes agree on some state of the
system, depending on implementation.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, users agree on who owns what bitcoin.</p>
<p>In Ethereum users agree on the correct execution of transactions and
the general state of the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Consensus attempts to create a reliable system from potentially
unreliable parts – parts like the computers in aircraft that are
vulnerable to bit flips due to radiation, or power outage in a data
center…</p>
<p>Or in public blockchains, where the ever changing network topology,
as well as the existence of malicious entities trying to subvert the
network for economic gain, for example, don’t align with the goals of
the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Instead of trusting the execution of individual processes or

<p>In order to understand blockchain technology like a pro, knowing its
ins and outs, we need to delve into the heart of what blockchain looks
like from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>This is where distributed systems come in.</p>
<p>Blockchains are a specific type of distributed system, and everything
we know to the present about distributed systems will allow us to
properly understand blockchain.</p>
<p>What is a distributed system?</p>
<p>The definition for a distributed system changes depending on who you
ask, but the general “consensus” (no pun intended) is that distributed
systems contain two particular categories of components.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08a. distributed systems: definition #2 (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image008a.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems: Definition #2"
  alt="Distributed Systems: Definition #2." />

<p>The first category is referred to as “nodes.”</p>
<p>Nodes are meant to represent separate machines, or processes.</p>
<p>This separation manifests in the real-world as physical distance,
such as in Bitcoin, or just a separation of components, similar to the
CPU cores in your laptop.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. distributed systems: definition #3 (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image008.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems: Definition #3"
  alt="Distributed Systems: Definition #3." />

<p>The second category is referred to as “message passing.”</p>
<p>These are represented as arrows, or “edges” as we like to call them
in the context of graph theory.</p>
<p>Regardless of their name, their purpose is to demonstrate that
information can move between machines.</p>
<p>It isn’t guaranteed that all machines are directly, or even
indirectly, connected.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t stop them from working together.</p>
<p>The biggest question on your mind, though, must be, “Why do
distributed systems matter?</p>
<p>What’s wrong with a single system?”</p>
<p>Well, the problem with machines in the real-world is that they can be
faulty, crash, lose memory, or even be corrupted.</p>
<p>In this event, we are able to protect information and services by
creating backups.</p>
<p>In other word, putting many machines together to accomplish a goal
together instead of just having a single machine.</p>
<p>This brings us the main advantage of a more reliable system: even if
one machine shuts down or misbehaves, it’s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>We can create protocols withstanding failure, giving us the power to
be safe in the event of a crash.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 09. distributed systems: properties (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image009.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems: Properties"
  alt="Distributed Systems: Properties." />

<p>Let’s discuss the properties of a distributed system keeping in mind
the two main two components to understand exactly what we’re working
with.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious components of a distributed system is
concurrency.</p>
<p>Components in this system process information concurrently, as
opposed to a single process which operates one step at a time.</p>
<p>Second, there is no global clock.</p>
<p>While all nodes can attempt to stay synchronized, there is no single
clock or computer to access for the current time.</p>
<p>Each node is responsible for maintaining its own time.</p>
<p>A fun fact, time and its effects on the operation of a distributed
system constantly comes up in heated debates across the academic
world.</p>
<p>Third, as mentioned before, there is the potential for failure of any
individual component, whether this be a dropped message or a failed
processor.</p>
<p>In these events, protocols protect the system against the individual
failure, ensuring that the job gets done no matter what.</p>
<p>All these properties of distributed systems come straight from
understanding the role of nodes and edges in this system.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’re going to look at how we distinguish a
working distributed system from a faulty one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 10. distributed systems: example (20) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image010.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Distributed Systems: Example"
  alt="Distributed Systems: Example." />
 
<p>This graph shows a classic example problem from distributed
systems.</p>
<p>Consider an arrangement of an odd number of nodes as such.</p>
<p>Imagine that each node randomly starts off with one of two values: 0
or 1.</p>
<p>This is known as a binary consensus problem, as there are only two
possible inputs for each node, and only two possible outputs for the
entire network.</p>
<p>The goal of this system is to, through messages and computation,
return the majority value among all nodes.</p>
<p>From looking at this graph, you can easily tell that the answer must
be 0, given that there are five zeroes and only four ones.</p>
<p>Before we start considering the exact process by which this system
can reach the answer, let’s first ask ourselves: what exactly are we
looking for in this system?</p>
<p>What properties do we want to uphold?</p>
<p>What constitutes a correct answer?</p>
<p>We’re about to answer those questions right now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"

  title="Distributed Systems: Properties of Multiprocess Programs"
  alt="Distributed Systems: Properties of Multiprocess Programs."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>Leslie Lamport, distributed systems researcher and superhero,
designed a scheme by which we can formally prove the correctness of a
distributed system.</p>
<p>It’s a fundamentally simple scheme, and it’s a scheme you can apply
to any kind of engineering.</p>
<p>Lamport says that a system is correct if two things are true: that it
doesn’t do bad things, and that it eventually does good things.</p>
<p>The formal terms for these are safety and liveness respectively.</p>
<p>Safety properties refer to things that will not happen, and liveness
refers to things that eventually happen.</p>
<p>To understand what this means, let’s use the previous example.</p>
<p>Which types of results do we want, and which do we not?</p>
<p>I would say it’s reasonably clear to see what we don’t want.</p>
<p>If our goal is for the majority value to be returned, then we never
want a program to return a value that is not the majority value.</p>
<p>That’s a safety property.</p>
<p>A liveness property is that the majority value will eventually be
returned.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the safety and liveness properties are difficult
to fulfill simultaneously, as getting closer to one means getting
further from the other.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice why we can’t have just safety or just
liveness.</p>
<p>Take real life as an example: living your life as safely as possible
would be staying inside all day and never talking to anyone.</p>
<p>Nothing can go wrong, true, but … nothing will ever happen
either.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could also be incredibly spontaneous to live
the most lively life imaginable.</p>
<p>However, without sufficient regulation of your actions, you’ll likely
get into serious trouble.</p>
<p>You need some of both, but not too much, to define a sense of what
your program can and should do.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 12. distributed consensus: correctness (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image012.png?raw=true"
  title="Distributed Consensus: Correctness"
  alt="Distributed Consensus: Correctness."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>We spent quite a bit of time understanding safety and liveness, but
how do we apply those ideas of desirable and undesirable guidelines to a
distributed system?</p>
<p>How can we prove that our system achieves its goal?</p>
<p>Well, for any distributed system to be correct, we know that it must
come to some form of consensus on the correct answer.</p>
<p>That’s the whole point of a distributed system: given some input, the
nodes need to agree on the output.</p>
<p>The names given to these consensus-achieving procedures are known as
consensus algorithms.</p>
<p>We can put consensus algorithms in the context of safety and liveness
by establishing what must happen, and what cannot happen, in order for a
system to come to consensus.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, computer scientists much smarter than us have already
done that, recognizing that the three requirements of any correct
consensus algorithm are validity, agreement, and termination.</p>
<p><em><strong>Validity</strong> means that any value decided upon by
the network must be proposed by one of the processes.</em></p>
<p>In other words, the consensus algorithm cannot arbitrarily agree on
some result.</p>
<p>It cannot be hardcoded to always return the value 0.</p>
<p>Sure, all our nodes will agree that the value is 0 and be in
agreement, but is that truly valid?</p>
<p>If every node started off with 1, and we’re looking for the majority
value, 0 is meaningless.</p>
<p><em><strong>Agreement</strong> means that all non-faulty processes must agree 
on the same value.</em></p>
<p>It’s pointless to bother with the results of faulty processes, since those can 
always be wrong, so what matters is the agreement of the remainder.</p>
<p>Of the working nodes, we never want to end up in a situation where one says 
0 and one says 1.</p>
<p>If there are inconsistencies in our results, then which one is true?</p>
<p>Which one is correct?</p>
<p>In order for the result to be meaningful, all functioning processes must 
agree on it.</p>
<p>The last requirement is termination.</p>
<p><em><strong>Termination</strong> means that all non-faulty nodes will 
eventually decide on some value.</em></p>
<p>In other words, the system must eventually return some value; it cannot 
forever hang in limbo.</p>
<p>As you can tell, both validity and agreement are safety properties.</p>
<p>They specify things that can never happen in a system correctly coming to 
consensus.</p>
<p>By having validity and agreement, we ensure that honest nodes never decide 
on trivial, random, or different values.</p>
<p>Termination, on the other hand, is a liveness property, as it specifies what 
must happen for the system to be considered correct.</p>
<p>Without the guarantee of termination, we have no guarantee that consensus will 
ever be achieved.</p>

<p>By understanding these three essentials of a consensus algorithm, you
now understand what is needed for any distributed system to come to
consensus.</p>
<p>In addition, identifying the goals of consensus algorithms is
critical to understanding different approaches.</p>
<p>Before we get into examples of consensus algorithms, however, we need
to understand more of the caveats of distributed systems, and the
tradeoffs that any system must make.</p>

<h3>CAP Theorem</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 14. cap theorem: introduction (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image014.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Introduction"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Introduction."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>This section hones in on a famous trilemma of distributed systems
called the CAP Theorem.</p>
<p>The most reasonable explanation for the name “CAP Theorem” is that
the researcher who came up with it, Eric Brewer, was wearing a cap to
cover his bald spot upon discovering this trilemma.</p>
<p>A less plausible but more popular theory is that “CAP” stands for the
three components of the trilemma: Consistency, Availability, and
Partition Tolerance.</p>
<p>These are not three random words, nor are they disconnected from the
previous section about safety, liveness, and consensus correctness.</p>
<p>After defining these terms and proving the CAP Theorem, we’ll delve
into the implications.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 15. cap theorem: consistency 'c' in cap (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image015.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Consistency 'C' in cap"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Consistency 'C' in cap."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>The “C” in CAP stands for Consistency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consistency</em></strong> in a system is defined as every
node providing the most recent state of the system.</p>
<p>If it does not have the most recent state, it will not provide any
response.</p>
<p>This, as you can tell, builds off the idea of safety because it
refers to something that will never happen.</p>
Consistency in a system says that no two nodes will return a different
state at any given time, and that no node will return an outdated state.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 16. cap theorem: availability 'a' in cap (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image016.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Availability 'A' in cap"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Availability 'A' in cap."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>The “A” in CAP stands for Availability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Availability</em></strong> in a system means that every
node has constant read and write access.</p>
<p>In other words, an available system allows me to make updates and
retrieve the state of the system without delay.</p>
<p>This, then, is born from liveness: availability promises what must
happen, which is the ability to read or write some state.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17. cap theorem: partition tolerance (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image017.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Partition Tolerance 'P' in cap"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Partition Tolerance 'P' in cap."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>And last but not least the “P” in CAP stands for
<strong><em>Partition Tolerance</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A quick definition, a partition is an inability for two or more nodes
in a network to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>If Node A cannot receive messages from Node B and vice versa, this
means there is a partition between the two.</p>
<p>You can consider partitions to be the equivalent of unbounded network
latency, meaning that messages will not get to their recipient.</p>
<p>Partition tolerance, then, is the ability to function in spite of
partitions within the network.</p>
<p>Partition tolerance is more difficult to categorize, but it also
falls in line with safety, as it specifies what will not happen.</p>
<p>Partition tolerance states that the network will not stop functioning
even with partitions.</p>

  alt="CAP Theorem: Nothing is Important." />

<p>What is the CAP Theorem, truly?</p>
<p>It is a simple statement: a system can only have two out of three of these 
properties at any given time.</p>
<p>The choice must be made between Consistency, Availability, and Partition 
Tolerance.</p>
<p>You see this intersection of the three right here?</p>
<p>This is what we like to call a “Magical Fantasy Land.”</p>
<p>Decades ago, when distributed systems were still new in academia, several 
researchers and organizations claimed they created systems which had all three 
properties.</p>
<p>We’ll give you a quick proof in just a second as to why the CAP Theorem is true.</p>
<p>In order to prove the CAP Theorem, let’s run through some examples.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 19. cap theorem: proof (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image019.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>In each example, we’re going to give an example of a situation in
which choosing two properties forces us to yield the third.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend this is a database which stores my favorite color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 20. cap theorem: proof #2 (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image020.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #2"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #2."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>In our first example, let’s choose Partition Tolerance and
Availability.</p>
<p>Here’s how we lose consistency:</p>
<p>Let’s say it’s the end of my senior year, I’m graduating from
Berkeley, but I get accepted into a graduate program at Stanford!</p>
<p>Naturally, my favorite color will have to change from blue to
red.</p>
<p>I send the update to the system, and my message happens to go to Node 1.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 21. cap theorem: proof #3 (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image021.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #3"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #3."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>Node 1 relays the update to all other accessible nodes, which update their 
state.</p>
<p>Nodes 2 and 4, however, cannot receive messages from the other half so are 
not aware of the update.</p>
<p>I later query Node 2 for my favorite color.</p>
<p>Node 2, according to our choice of Availability, will return its current state.</p>
<p>However, this is not the most recent state, as the most recent update was red.</p>
<p>Because Node 2 provided a state that was not the most recent, it was not 
Consistent.</p>
<p>Let’s try another configuration, particularly Partition Tolerance and Consistency.</p>
<p>We’ll see how that ends up sacrificing Availability.</p>
<p>Same scenario,</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 22. cap theorem: proof #4 (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image022.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #4"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #4." />

<p>I send the update to Node 1, which then sends the update to other nodes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 23. cap theorem: proof #5 (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image023.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #5"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #5."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>Nodes 2 and 4 are still ignorant of the update to red.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. cap theorem: proof #6 (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image024.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #6"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #6."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>Again, I query Node 2.</p>
<p>What happens this time?</p>
<p>Since Node 2 is bound to consistency, it chooses not to return anything.</p>
<p>The bad news is we get no information, but the good news is we get no outdated 
information.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how Node 2 knows its outdated, we can say that it first 
asks all other nodes for updates before returning a state.</p>
<p>If it cannot receive messages from all nodes, it will assume it has outdated 
information and refuse to return a value.</p>
<p>We lose out on something in the last two examples, so let’s see what happens 
when we choose Consistency and Availability.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 25. cap theorem: proof #7 (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image025.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #7"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #7."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>I send an update to Node 1.</p>
<p>Node 1 passes the information around.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 26. cap theorem: proof #8 (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image026.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Proof #8"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Proof #8."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>I query Node 2, and it returns a value to me.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Everything worked as expected.</p>
<p>Except, there’s one problem:</p>
<p>If we throw in a partition, this wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>If we throw in a partition, we are forced into one of the first two situations.</p>
<p>And this proof demonstrates the spirit of the CAP Theorem, that a system must 
compromise.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image027.png?raw=true"
  title="CAP Theorem: Notes"
  alt="CAP Theorem: Notes."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>Now you understand the CAP Theorem.</p>
<p>You’ll often hear discussion about Consistency and Availability in
consensus algorithm discussion.</p>
<p>However, there are a few notes to include in your takeaways of this
lecture that will let you better appreciate the CAP Theorem’s
significance and implications.</p>
<p>First, although our proof used extremes, these three properties are
not black and white.</p>
<p>They are instead on a spectrum.</p>
<p>For example, instead of never returning a value to stay consistent
but give up all availability, a node might wait 5 or 10 seconds before
giving in and returning some value.</p>
<p>In addition, there might not be unbreakable partitions in your
system, but network latency may cause state discrepancies.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing the CAP Theorem in absolutes, consider
compromises.</p>
<p>In addition, almost every reasonable system will assume that
partitions are going to occur in the system, meaning that choosing P as
one of two properties is a given.</p>
<p>For this reason, the CAP Theorem often reduces to a dilemma between
Consistency and Availability.</p>
<p>The choice is whether it is preferable for the system to return a
false or outdated value, or to simply not return a value at all.</p>
<p>On this choice hinges all the implications of the CAP Theorem.</p>
<p>Lastly, many in the blockchain space will take the CAP Theorem too
seriously.</p>
<p>Because many do not have a formal distributed systems background,
some incorrectly fixate on the black-and-white implications of the CAP
Theorem rather than using it as another lens to view the system’s
design.</p>

<h3>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 28. byzantine fault tolerance: generals' problem (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image028.png?raw=true"
  title="Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Generals' Problem"
  alt="Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Generals' Problem."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>We’ve defined distributed systems, understood the definition of
correctness in their context, and understood the various properties and
limitations of these systems. We’re now going to finish off by
understanding all the possible areas in which these systems can fail,
best summarized by the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.</p>
<p>The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is a question of consensus. Allow me
to tell you the story of the Byzantine generals, laying siege to an
enemy city.</p>
<p>They’ve all surrounded the city, but there’s a problem: large
physical barriers, like mountains and canyons, separate the generals.
They can communicate only by sending messengers. In addition, they had
not decided prior whether to attack the city, or to give up and
retreat.</p>
<p>Only after observing the enemy do they then decided on a common plan
of action.</p>
<p>Only an attack launched by all generals at once can successfully
conquer the city. Having come this far, they send messages with their
votes on how to proceed.</p>
<p>“Okay,” you may ask, “if they can send messages to each other, then
what’s the issue? They just need to collect enough information, right?
So what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>Well, the problem is that some generals may have been bribed. In
exchange for their betrayal, they’ll earn themselves a small fortune
from the city. These traitor generals will send incorrect information to
their peers in order to screw up the attack, preventing consensus. In
addition, their messengers might get lost or corrupt their messages.</p>
<p>The question which remains: how do we achieve consensus, if we can at
all? Spoiler alert: there is no solution in the presence of ⅓ or greater
percentage potential traitor generals.</p>
<p>We call these potential traitor generals Byzantine nodes, which may
act maliciously or arbitrarily.</p>
<p>In this image, there are two separate triangles. We consider
scenarios with 3 generals and 1 traitor, since the case is trivial with
just 1 or 2 generals.</p>
<p>Let’s say the first general to send out a message is the commanding
general issuing commands, and the listening generals are the lieutenant
generals.</p>
<p>The node on top of the triangle is the “Commander,” and the bottom
two nodes are labeled “Lieutenant 1” on the left and “Lieutenant 2” on
the right. The commander casts a vote for either “attack” or “retreat”
and the lieutenants record the vote.</p>
<p>As you can see in the first triangle, Lieutenant 2 is shaded. This
implies, according to our story, it’s a traitor bribed by the enemy. In
distributed systems terms, it’s a Byzantine node. Either way, it’s going
to send incorrect information to its peers. Let’s say the commander
votes to “attack,” sending the message to both Lieutenant 1 and
Lieutenant</p>
<p>2. Lieutenant 2, to mess things up, tells Lieutenant 1 that the
commander said “retreat.”</p>
<p>Lieutenant 1 now sees two different facts, only one of which can be
true: the commander said attack, or the commander said retreat.</p>
<p>In the second triangle, the commander is shaded instead. It tells
Lieutenant 1 to “attack,” but sends a conflicting message to Lieutenant
2, telling it to “retreat.” Lieutenant 2 dutifully reports to Lieutenant
1 that the commander said to “retreat,” but Lieutenant 1’s problem
remains. Notice that, for Lieutenant 1, the information he’s receiving
is exactly the same as the previous scenario even though the Byzantine
node changed. The Commander is telling it to “attack,” but the other
Lieutenant claims otherwise. Because these two situations are
indistinguishable, the Lieutenant cannot detect which node is malicious.
In addition, because there is no clear majority value, Lieutenant 1
cannot decide on a value. With just one Byzantine node out of three,
it’s impossible to achieve consensus.</p>
<p>This example with three nodes extends to any general set of nodes
attempting to come to consensus, meaning that consensus with the
presence of ⅓ or more Byzantine generals is impossible. If there were a
solution that could tolerate more than ⅓ Byzantine nodes, we could use
it to solve this much more simple scenario with 3 nodes. Since we know 3
nodes cannot come to consensus with one Byzantine node, we can extend
this to a general fraction.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to make an algorithm for
the remaining situations.</p>

<p>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance released in 1999 by Miguel Castro
and Barbara Liskov gives an algorithm to allow nodes to come to
consensus with no more than ⅓ Byzantine nodes. This paper has inspired
many iterations of Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithms, especially as
research into blockchain consensus algorithms continues.</p>
<p>Let’s formalize the various types of faults within distributed
systems. There are two main types of faults that are possible. While we
can get more detail between the types of faults, these two are the most
fundamental to understand.</p>
<p>The first type of fault is a fail-stop fault. During a fail-stop
fault, the node can crash or not return values. Recall that a node’s
functionality includes sending, receiving, storing, and processing
information. Early research into distributed consensus first aimed to
solve these kinds of problems. This kind of failure may be temporary or
indefinite, but it will always be easier to handle than the second type
of fault.</p>

<p>A Byzantine fault, referring to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem, is a
fault that refers to any arbitrary deviance from the protocol. In other
words, not only might nodes stop replying or receiving information, but
they may also send corrupted and/or false information.</p>
<p>You can note that Byzantine faults are a superset of fail-stop
faults.</p>
<p>The behavior of most attackers, such as the bribed generals trying to
hinder consensus, falls under this kind of fault. It is this type of
fault that all public blockchains must protect against, since the
participants in the blockchain network are unknown and
unpredictable.</p>
<p>Of course, the question after learning all this distributed systems
material is, “How does this relate to blockchain fundamentals?”</p>
<p>Keep in mind the nature of blockchain. We’ve described it as many
things: a technological solution to a social problem, the world’s worst
database, and a replacement for trusted third parties. But what is it in
the context of distributed systems?</p>
<p>Well, a blockchain is simply a data structure governed by a
distributed system with an unbounded number of participants in the
consensus process and an unknown number of Byzantine faults possible. In
other words, it’s the most adversarial environment possible. In spite of
the incredibly low amount of restrictions possible, blockchain makes it
possible foreveryone to come to consensus.</p>
<p>Clearly, the distribution of computational power and data storage
represents the geographic distance between the generals. The nodes
represent generals, and the traitors represent faulty or malicious
nodes. The possible dropped packets or messages between nodes represent
unreliable messengers, and coming to consensus on whether to include a
block or the valid chain of transaction history is the same as coming to
agreement on whether to attack or retreat. It’s the same concepts with
different names.</p>

<h3>Intro: Voting Based Consensus</h3>

<p>Now that we have an understanding of the fundamentals of distributed systems 
and distributed consensus, our main focus for the next section is that of 
classical consensus mechanisms which have been the backbone of distributed 
systems for decades, where file stores had to be safely and consistently shared 
across a network, used by large enterprises around the world.</p>
<p>These mechanisms primarily had processes explicitly vote on new updates to 
the system usually in a series of rounds.</p>
<p>Based on formal distributed consensus research, these consensus mechanisms 
focused on backing in sound mathematical reasoning and formal proofs.</p>
<p>They were often very difficult to implement, and when deployed, were usually 
run on networks with very few nodes – especially when compared to the global 
blockchain networks of today.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at some classical consensus mechanisms and 
their impact.</p>
<p>After, we’ll see their evolution and how they inspired the blockchain systems 
of today.</p>

<h3>Paxos and Raft</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 31. paxos overview (42) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  style="width:45%;"
  title="PAXOS Overview"
  alt="PAXOS Overview." />

<p>Before we talk about our first consensus mechanisms, let’s take a
short break.</p>
<p>We’ve been going through a lot of technical material, so for now,
let’s just enjoy some nice, relaxing images.</p>
<p>All these images are from a beautiful island called Paxos, located
off the west coast of Greece.</p>
<p>It’s famous for its wine and is home to some of the finest sand
beaches in all of the Ionian Sea.</p>
<p>Apparently, it’s also a very popular yachting location.</p>
<p>Yeah, right there on the map, on the west side of Greece, just south
of Corfu, is Paxos!</p>
<p>The most important thing though is that not only is Paxos a Greek
island, but also…a consensus algorithm!</p>
<p>Invented by Leslie Lamport in 1989: the same guy responsible for the
Byzantine Generals Problem, some other very influential papers in the
field of distributed systems, such as Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of
Events in a Distributed System, and also author of LaTeX, the famous
document preparation system.</p>
<p>Since publication, Paxos has been used for a variety of use cases,
and has spawned an entire family of consensus algorithms.
Implementations may vary, but here, we’ll talk about the basic Paxos
algorithm.</p>
<p>The reason Paxos is named the way it is is because the original
whitepaper was titled The Part-Time Parliament, and in the paper,
Lamport told the story of how the ancient Paxon parliament used the
Paxos algorithm to pass decrees and make sure everyone on the island was
in consensus of the latest law.</p>
<p>And the reason it was the “part-time” parliament was that legislators
in the Paxon parliament were known to leave sporadically – to attend
banquets and other outside activities.</p>
<p>No one was willing to remain in the chambers all the time, and they
didn’t have secretaries either, so instead, each Paxon legislator
maintained a ledger, where they’d record everything that happened.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 32. paxos terminology (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image032.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PAXOS Terminology"
  alt="PAXOS Terminology." />

<p>Diving a bit more in depth, the paper specifies that within the Paxon
parliament, there are three types of legislators: proposers, acceptors,
and learners.</p>
<p>Proposers champion the requests of citizens, and bring up new bills
to others in Paxon parliament.</p>
<p>Acceptors are legislators that vote, and after consensus is reached,
learners “learn” the result of the consensus and carry out the bill.</p>
<p>In order for consensus to be reached, a majority of acceptors must
vote for a new bill.</p>
<p>We call any majority of acceptors a quorum.</p>
<p>A key observation to make here is that any two quorums must
overlap.</p>
<p>We’ll see later on that the idea of quorums is also very important in
other consensus algorithms, such as those that are considered federated
consensus algorithms.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 33. paxos main idea (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image033.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PAXOS Main Idea"
  alt="PAXOS Main Idea." />

<p>The protocol that the Paxon parliament uses proceeds over several
rounds, until consensus is reached.</p>
<p>Each successful round has two phases: prepare and accept.</p>
<p>First, some citizens will talk to a proposer.</p>
<p>And then after that, the proposer proposes a decree to the Paxon
parliament.</p>
<p>A decree has a number and a value, the value can be anything, such as
“The sale of brown goats is permitted,” or “Painting on temple walls is
forbidden.”</p>
<p>However, there’s a requirement that the number associated with the
decree must be strictly increasing.</p>
<p>After a decree is proposed, within the parliament, the acceptors
discuss.</p>
<p>If at any point in time, a quorum, or majority, of legislators are in
the chambers, and all vote yes, then the decree would be passed, and
they’d all write it down on everyone’s ledgers.</p>
<p>After reaching consensus, the learners learn the result, and then let
the entire island know what happened in parliament.</p>

  style="width:45%;"
  title="PAXOS Knowledge of the Ancients"
  alt="PAXOS Knowledge of the Ancients." />

<p>There’s a very clear parallel between the Paxon parliament and
distributed consensus.</p>
<p>As Lamport put it in his paper: “There’s an obvious correspondence
between this database system and the Paxon Parliament.”</p>
<p>Individual nodes within a distributed system are like the
legislators, since they’re the ones whose job it is to serve the
citizens – the client programs – and come to consensus, and then
broadcast or take action on the result.</p>
<p>And the state of the distributed database is like the current law
passed by the parliament.</p>

  style="width:45%;"
  title="PAXOS in Practice: Assumptions & Real-World Use"
  alt="PAXOS in Practice: Assumptions & Real-World Use." />

<p>One major assumption that Paxos makes is that nodes aren’t trying to
subvert the protocol, and that messages are delivered without
corruption.</p>
<p>In other words, Paxos only works for the fail-stop scenario, and does
not account for Byzantine faults.</p>
<p>In the paper, Lamport describes that the people of Paxos are fairly
agreeable and that there’s an atmosphere of mutual trust on the
island.</p>
<p>So long as they’re in the chambers, all legislators would agree with
one another.</p>
<p>The result of this is that Paxos is very fast, and in practice is
used to replicate large sets of data.</p>
<p>At Google, Paxos is used in their Chubby distributed lock service,
where it’s very important for everyone to agree to only allow one
process to have write access to a certain piece of data at a given
time.</p>
<p>And just to name a few more, Google Spanner, Microsoft Bing
Autopilot, Heroku, WeChat, and WANDisco all use Paxos internally.</p>
<p>The original Paxos whitepaper was known to be pretty difficult to
understand, and despite the original author’s efforts to clarify
further, with a follow up paper titled “Paxos Made Simple,” it still
caused mass confusion – maybe because of the huge Paxon parliament
story.</p>

<p>In 2014, an alternative to Paxos was proposed.</p>
<p>The paper was titled “In Search of an Understandable Consensus
Algorithm,” poking fun at the confusion Paxos caused, and even the name
of the algorithm – Raft – is meant to be a joke.</p>
<p>You’d use a raft to escape the island of Paxos.</p>
<p>The general consensus nowadays is that Raft is a bit more
understandable than Paxos, and easier to implement.</p>
<p>Its design is leader-based, meaning that on each round a leader would
be chosen to propose new updates, and JP Morgan’s Quorum, which was
designed to be an enterprise version of Ethereum, swaps out the public
Proof-of-Work algorithm that Ethereum uses for a faster Raft-based
consensus.</p>

  title="Raft How it Works"
  alt="Raft How it Works." />

<p>There’s a really good Raft simulation that I’ll link in the “Readings” section 
for this week, but here’s a brief rundown of how Raft consensus works.</p>
<p>Each instance of Raft has one elected leader, who communicates with the client 
directly.</p>
<p>The leader’s responsible for orchestrating the sending of messages to other 
nodes within the cluster and for maintaining log replication of everything that 
happens.</p>
<p>The leader accepts a client request, and then oversees all other nodes to 
make sure that they too have followed the request; and then the log of that 
request is replicated.</p>
<p>The leader leads the whole consensus until it fails or stops, in which case 
a new leader is elected.</p>
<p>And the consensus algorithm proceeds in partial synchrony.</p>
<p>The leader is tasked with sending out “heartbeat” messages to other
nodes, telling everyone else that it’s online.</p>
<p>And these heartbeats are sent out at regular intervals – like an
actual heartbeat.</p>
<p>If no other nodes hear a heartbeat, then they can assume that the leader is 
dead – failed, stopped, or crashed – and then they too start an election cycle.</p>
<p>This involves all nodes beginning an internal timer, starting whenever they 
realize that they’re no longer receiving heartbeats, and the first node to timeout 
gets to become the new leader.</p>
<p>And just as a reminder, please check out this awesome raft simulation that 
we’ll link in the readings section.</p>
<p>It teaches everything we just went over in the previous slide but by example.</p>

<h3>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. pbft overview (49) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image038.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT Overview"
  alt="PBFT Overview." />

<p>We’ll end here with another famous consensus algorithm: Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or PBFT. Published by Miguel Castro and
Barbara Liskov in 1999, the original paper posed a solution to the
Byzantine Generals problem, as we previously mentioned.</p>
<p>Paxos and Raft aren’t by default Byzantine fault tolerant, though
there are variants of them – like BFT-Paxos – that are. PBFT was one of
the original papers published on the topic of solving consensus when
considering Byzantine faults.</p>
<p>The PBFT algorithm handles less than ⅓ Byzantine faults, as we saw in
the section with the Byzantine generals problem. More traditionally,
this has been written as: the system can handle f Byzantine faults,
where there are 3f + 1 total nodes.</p>
<p>It’s also really fast. The original PBFT paper showed that when
integrated with standard unreplicated NFS, a distributed file system
protocol developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, the resulting BFT-NFS is
only 3% slower, despite the fact that it can now withstand Byzantine
faults.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. pbft by example (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image039.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT By Example"
  alt="PBFT By Example." />

<p>The main PBFT algorithm consists of three phases – pre-prepare,
prepare, and commit.</p>
<p>PBFT begins when the client submits a request to the primary node.
The primary node is responsible for advocating for the client request,
and this should be familiar since it’s a common design pattern. For
example, remembering back to Paxos, the Proposer proposes new decrees to
other legislators in the Paxon Parliament based on the requests of the
people.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. pbft by example request (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image040.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example Request"
  alt="PBFT by Example Request." />

<p>In this case, the primary node is Derrick. We have a total of 4
nodes, meaning that we should be able to withstand 1 fault, since ¼ is
less than ⅓. So, let’s say one of our 4 nodes, Nadir, drops out due to a
spotty internet connection.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 41. pbft by example request #2 (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image041.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example Request #2"
  alt="PBFT by Example Request #2." />

<p>Nadir might’ve dropped out, but the other 3 nodes might not know that
yet, so they’ll still send messages to him.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 42. pbft by example: pre-prepare (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image042.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example: Pre-Prepare"
  alt="PBFT by Example: Pre-Prepare." />

<p>The next step is pre-prepare, which is one of the three main phases – pre-
prepare, prepare, and commit. In the pre-prepare phase, the primary node 
Derrick sends out pre-prepare messages to everyone in the network. A node 
accepts the pre-prepare message so long as its valid. We won’t go too much 
in detail, but messages contain a sequence number – like the increasing 
numbers Proposers in Paxos assign to each of their decrees. They also 
contain signatures, and other useful metadata that lets nodes - 
determine message validity.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 43. pbft by example: prepare (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image043.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example: Prepare"
  alt="PBFT by Example: Prepare." />
  
<p>If a node accepts a pre-prepare message, it follows up by sending out
a prepare message to everyone else. And prepare messages are accepted by
receiving nodes so long as they’re valid, again, based on sequence
number, signature, and other metadata. A node is considered “prepared”
if it has seen the original request from the primary node, has
pre-prepared, and has seen 2f prepare messages that match its
pre-prepare – making for 2f + 1 prepares. Again, f is the number of
Byzantine faults.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 44. pbft by example: commit (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image044.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example: Commit"
  alt="PBFT by Example: Commit." />

<p>After nodes have prepared, they send out a commit message. If a node
receives f + 1 valid commit messages, then they carry out the client
request and then finally</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 45. pbft by example: reply (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image045.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="PBFT by Example: Reply"
  alt="PBFT by Example: Reply." />

<p>Send out the reply to the client. The client waits for f + 1 of the
same reply. Since we allow for at most f faults, we need to wait for at
least f + 1, and this ensures the response to be valid. After this
point, the client gets the correct response.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram from the PBFT whitepaper, which models exactly the
scenario we just went over. The diagram has five processes, or nodes in
our case.</p>
<p>The client is process C. Derrick is process 0, I’m process 1, Gloria
is process 2, and Nadir is process 3.</p>
<p>In the first step, the client sent a message to Derrick, process 0.
That’s the initial request. During this time, Nadir fails.</p>
<p>Then, Derrick sends a pre-prepare message to the rest of us
processes.</p>
<p>Everyone except Nadir responds with a prepare message.</p>
<p>After acknowledging everyone’s presence, we all send the commit
message.</p>
<p>After hearing sufficient amount of commits, we respond directly to
the client.</p>

<h3>Intro: Nakamoto Consensus</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve traversed the landscape of classical voting-based
consensus mechanisms, we now arrive in modern times.</p>
<p>In 2008, the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper not only
revolutionized the way we thought of financial transactions, but also
the way we reach consensus.</p>
<p>For the first time, consensus was enabled not just at a small scale
within a single company, but at the globally accessible level.</p>
<p>In the present day, we can observe two main classes of consensus
mechanisms: ones inspired by classical literature – which we call
voting-based consensus mechanisms – and ones inspired by Satoshi
Nakamoto’s Bitcoin – which we call Nakamoto consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two is based on how updates
happen.</p>
<p>“Voting-based” refers to consensus mechanism requiring explicit votes
from nodes on the next update.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nakamoto consensus mechanisms diverge
fundamentally from this idea, instead requiring users to vote
implicitly.</p>
<p>This is done with a random lottery based on consumed resources: users
expend some resource for the chance to make an update to the system.</p>
<p>This is what happens in Bitcoin – miners are randomly selected based
on their hash power, derived from energy, to propose the next block.</p>
<p>While the origins of Nakamoto consensus are in Bitcoin’s
Proof-of-Work mechanism, it isn’t the only style of Nakamoto
Consensus.</p>
<p>That’s what we’re going to be covering in this section.</p>

<h3>Nakamoto Consensus</h3>

<p>In general, Nakamoto consensus delivers a few key properties.</p>
<p>First off, this paradigm serves as a way to come to consensus with
unknown, untrusted peers.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, the first distributed system to use Nakamoto Consensus
(hence the name “Nakamoto Consensus”), anyone can join or leave the
network at any time and even send corrupted messages or false messages
to others.</p>
<p>Additionally, any user can have as many virtual identities, or
public/private key pairs, as they want.</p>
<p>To prevent unfair voting from anyone who dishonestly creates multiple
identities, voting power must be made scarce, done by tying voting power
to a scarce resource.</p>
<p>Bitcoin happened to use computational power as the scarce resource,
but that is just one of many possible resources to expend to achieve
Nakamoto consensus.</p>
<p>Because of this implicit manner of voting, leaders are elected
through a random lottery, where the likelihood of winning this lottery
increases with the expended resources, pay-to-play style.</p>
<p>The winner of the lottery is then allowed to create the next update
to the system.</p>
<p>In blockchain networks, the block represents that very update.</p>
<p>When the vote is cast, it’s possible that the lottery chose a
malicious leader.</p>
<p>In this case, others in the network vote implicitly on the proposed
update by either including the update in their own local view of the
system state or by refusing to accept it.</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, full nodes can choose which blocks they
include in their blockchain: but their chain will only be valid if the
rest of the network is in consensus.</p>
<p>Hence, each Nakamoto Consensus protocol must have a set of rules
defining how to choose the most valid state of the network, such as the
longest chain policy in Bitcoin, one example of a fork resolution
policy.</p>
<p>For this reason, some choose to refer to Nakamoto consensus as
chain-based consensus.</p>
<p>We’ll understand this better in a bit when we look at chain and BFT
based Proof-of-Stake implementations.</p>
<p>In the next couple slides, we’ll be taking a look at various
consensus mechanisms that fall under the wide umbrella of Nakamoto
Consensus, and for each, we’ll be focusing on what resource each
consumes and how the network uses that resource to come to
consensus.</p>
<p>First, just as a recap and to understand Nakamoto Consensus in
something that we already know, take Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, miners solve partial preimage hash puzzles so as to
prevent naive Sybil attacks, and to tie voting power to a scarce
physical resource.</p>
<p>The image on the right-hand side is from our first course: Bitcoin
and Cryptocurrencies, and shows exactly that.</p>
<p>The miner who solves the block first gets to send it to the rest of
the network.</p>
<p>The rest of the network then implicitly votes on that block, since
they have the power to choose to append it to their local copies of the
blockchain.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, the resource consumed is computational power.</p>
<p>The faster a miner can compute hashes, the more likely they’re able
to find the next valid block and send it to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The next example of Nakamoto consensus is Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>This one’s a bit tricky since there are very many different
implementations of Proof-of-Stake, but in general some of them can be
classified as Nakamoto consensus mechanisms as well.</p>
<p>Like the miners in Proof-of-Work, validators in Proof-of-Stake are
tasked with creating updates and supporting the network.</p>
<p>Instead of expending computational power, Proof-of-Stake instead uses
its native currency.</p>
<p>As in: the more native currency a validator stakes, the more likely
it’s going to be elected to propose or create the next update.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to talk about when it comes to Proof-of-Stake, so we’ll
be going into that in the next section, after the following comparisons
with other Nakamoto consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Activity is a hybrid consensus mechanism that borrows from
both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>The general algorithm is as follows: First, miners solve and submit
blocks to the system, in the standard Proof-of-Work fashion.</p>
<p>Then, the system switches to Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>The block header contains data that represents a random group of
validators who are required to sign the new block.</p>
<p>And like in Proof-of-Stake, the more coins a validator has staked,
the more likely they are to be chosen to sign off of the block.</p>
<p>The block fees and rewards are split among the miner and the various
validators.</p>
<p>Once the validators have signed the newly found block, the block is
complete and users are free to add it to their copies of the
blockchain.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Activity, the resources consumed are both Proof-of-Work
and Proof-of-Stake resources.</p>
<p>Miners consume computational power, and validators consume the native
currency.</p>
<p>Next up is Proof-of-Burn.</p>
<p>It’s like Proof-of-Stake, but edgier.</p>
<p>This one’s a bit tricky since the term Proof-of-Burn can be used to
refer to a number of things.</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, you can prove the existence of arbitrary
data by sending a transaction to an irretrievable address, thereby
writing your data into the blockchain and paying the transaction fees to
no one, “burning” your coin.</p>
<p>That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Burn, in this context, refers to a Nakamoto consensus
mechanism.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Burn, the more coins you send to an irretrievable
address, or the more coins you “burn”, the higher the likelihood is of
you being elected and being able to create the next block.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Burn is like Proof-of-Stake, except that once you stake your
coin, you can’t get it back.</p>
<p>As a side note, burning coins can also be used as a bootstrapping
mechanism for new systems.</p>
<p>You could tie a new coin’s value to some other existing coin.</p>
<p>For example, a new cryptocurrency could derive its value from the
burning of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In summary, the resource being consumed in Proof-of-Burn is currency
– and that could be either native currency, or potentially some other
non-native currency.</p>
<p>Another novel category of Nakamoto Consensus is Proof-of-Space.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Space consumes storage space as a limiting resource for
voting power.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Space is seen by some to be more fair and energy efficient
than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work, due to the
availability of storage, as well as its lower energy cost.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Proof-of-Space is used primarily for file storage rather
than as a implicit voting method, though the implementations vary.</p>
<p>For example, there are also protocols that give rewards directly for
storing information, such as Filecoin, Storj, and Sia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Proof-of-Capacity is a type of Proof-of-Space that
is very similar to the other Nakamoto Consensus mechanisms we’ve been
talking about.</p>
<p>Instead of proving you’ve done work or staked some coin, you show
that you’ve solved some problem involving a nontrivial amount of storage
capacity.</p>
<p>Then you can propose the next block or update to the system and
receive coins for your computation.</p>
<p>In a sense, Proof-of-Capacity can be seen as a memory-hard
Proof-of-Work protocol.</p>
<p>At their core though, all these systems use some sort of
Proof-of-Space in order to limit user’s influence on the system.</p>
<p>There’s also Proof-of-Elapsed-Time, which has users consume time.</p>
<p>The way they do this is by first picking a random duration of time to
wait, and then waiting for that duration of time.</p>
<p>In order to enable this sort of behavior, we need to trust the users
are actually waiting for however long they say they’re waiting, and that
it’s truly random.</p>
<p>This is where Trusted Execution Environments come in, particularly
Intel SGXs.</p>
<p>Trusted Execution Environments are separate environments from your
computer’s main memory that can only be accessed with certain CPU
instructions.</p>
<p>This prevents tampering by other external processes.</p>
<p>Think processes that govern fingerprint sensors on mobile devices, or
alternative payment options.</p>
<p>The way it works is that we simply ask users to wait a random time,
and once that random time is up, then they get to propose the next
update.</p>
<p>The two assumptions to satisfy here are (1) that the time chosen to
wait is actually random, and (2) that we have actually waited that
long.</p>
<p>And this is functionality that is built in to trusted execution
environments.</p>
<p>Once code is loaded into the trusted execution environment, it
generates an attestation, or proof that the environment is working as
intended, and that the right code is running the right way.</p>
<p>Users can’t interfere with the trusted execution environment since
the memory space that it runs on is private, and any sort of tampering
would result in a faulty attestation.</p>
<p>However, this is all based on your trust in the manufacturer of the
trusted execution environments.</p>
<p>If you’re using Intel SGX, you have to trust Intel and their entire
production process, that they haven’t accidentally – or maliciously –
introduced a backdoor or vulnerability.</p>
<p>A mechanism that does not directly fall under the category of
Nakamoto consensus, but that is worth mentioning, is
Proof-of-Authority.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Authority relies on trusted individuals signing off on
updates to the network, and is primarily used in permissioned or
non-production networks.</p>
<p>For example, the Kovan and Rinkeby Ethereum test networks use Clique,
a Proof-of-Authority implementation.</p>
<p>Following some attacks on Ropsten, Proof-of-Authority was chosen as a
way to better control vulnerable, valuable, but not publicly controlled
testnets.</p>
<p>The resource consumed here is Identity.</p>
<p>There is a question mark because this follows the paradigm of
politically centralized systems, with a few actors making decisions for
the rest of the network.</p>

<h3>Intro: Proof-of-Stake</h3>

<p>Proof-of-Stake is a pretty important consensus mechanism – so much so
that we have this entire section on it.</p>
<p>With increasing concern over the energy costs and scalability of
Proof-of-Work blockchain platforms, many have turned to Proof-of-Stake
as an alternative.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll understand Proof-of-Stake first by comparing
it with well-known Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll dive more in depth into Proof-of-Stake’s implementation
specifics: how some implementations of it occupy a gray area between BFT
voting and Nakamoto consensus flavors, and also how innovations in this
space are driving blockchain research from a cryptoeconomics standpoint,
which aims to formalize all its claims about blockchain through
cryptography and economics.</p>

<h3>Proof-of-Stake Overview</h3>

  title="POW vs POS? Differences"
  alt="POW vs POS? Differences." />

<p>As we mentioned in the Nakamoto consensus section, we can understand
both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake by looking at what resources are
consumed.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, miners have voting power that’s proportional to the
amount of computational power that they own.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Stake, validators are stakeholders that have voting power
proportional to the economic stake – the native currency – that they
lock up.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the more invested someone is within a
Proof-of-Stake system, as in the more coin they have, the stronger the
incentive for them to be good stewards of the system.</p>
<p>Someone with a lot of stake has an incentive to do things that would
benefit the system as a whole since that would increase the value of the
coins they hold. That’s why in Proof-of-Stake, we give these individuals
the most power as validators.</p>
<p>And there’s two main flavors of Proof-of-Stake. Chain-based, and
BFT-based. The main differences are in the roles of a chosen validator
and its implications on the properties of the system and its
consensus.</p>
<p>In chain-based Proof-of-Stake, a validator is first randomly chosen
based on the proportion of stake they invested. Given a known validator
set, the validator who stakes the most coin is the most likely to be
chosen.</p>
<p>After this step, the chosen validator then creates a block which
points to the previously created block.</p>
<p>Then, this validator gets the block reward and transaction fees
associated to that block, assuming that the block is valid and accepted
by the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The main observation to make here is that chain-based Proof-of-Stake
is like a direct parallel of Proof-of-Work. Besides the difference in
resource consumed – computational power versus economic stake – the rest
of the mechanism is largely the same. Once a miner or validator is
chosen, they create a block that the rest of the network then implicitly
votes on, depending on whether or not they choose to accept the update
and append it to their local copies of the blockchain. This is why
chain-based Proof-of-Stake algorithms tend to choose availability over
consistency.</p>
<p>The next flavor of Proof-of-Stake is called BFT – or Byzantine Fault
Tolerant – based Proof-of-Stake. BFT-based Proof-of-Stake algorithms
choose consistency over availability, in contrast to the
availability-favoring chain-based Proof-of-Stake algorithms.</p>
<p>In the first step of BFT-based Proof-of-Stake, we have the same thing
as chain-based Proof-of-Stake: we randomly choose a validator based on
the proportion of stake they have invested.</p>
<p>The differences start in the next step though.</p>
<p>Instead of having a chosen validator directly create a block that is
sent directly to the entire network, a chosen validator proposes the
next block. The rest of the validators then vote “yes” or “no” on
whether they accept the block to be valid or not.</p>
<p>If ⅔ or more of the network voting power (⅔ or more of the total
stake) votes yes, then the block is included in the blockchain.
Otherwise, a new validator is chosen to propose a block, and we
repeat.</p>
<p>After a block gets more than ⅔ of the network voting power to vote
“yes” on it, the validator that proposed that block gets the block
reward and transaction fees.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been a couple major implementations of
Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>Tendermint was the first BFT-based Proof-of-Stake consensus
mechanism, published in 2014. Tendermint is currently used as the
consensus mechanism for Cosmos, the internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>Casper is the planned Proof-of-Stake upgrade to Ethereum. There are
two big implementations of Casper. The first is Casper the Friendly
GHOST: Correct-by-Construction, part of a family of consensus algorithms
designed from scratch based on the same safety proof.</p>
<p>The second is Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, which is a
Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake hybrid.</p>

<h3>Proof-of-Stake Implementations</h3>

  style="width:45%;"
  title="Proof-of-Stake: Tendermint"
  alt="Proof-of-Stake: Tendermint." />

<p>Tendermint was the first BFT-based Proof-of-Stake consensus
mechanism, created by Jae Kwon and his team in 2014.</p>
<p>To give a bit of historical context, Tendermint brought with it the
academic rigor of more traditional consensus mechanisms such as PBFT,
Paxos, and Raft to a space that at the time was mostly dominated by
newer blockchain consensus mechanisms, namely Proof-of-Work and other
Nakamoto consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Tendermint was an all-inclusive Proof-of-Stake
system with its own native token to drive incentive, but since then, it
has evolved to become a more generalized middleware for replicating
applications on many machines. This allows developers to write their
applications and business logic in any language. These applications talk
to what’s called the Application BlockChain Interface, which in turn
talks to the Tendermint Core consensus engine. You can see a diagram of
the state machine on the right.</p>
<p>Tendermint is energy efficient and fast, but currently is still
testing scalability to a large number of validators, so today it’s
primarily being used in production in private, permissioned
environments.</p>
<p>It’s also the backbone of the Cosmos Network, which aims to create
the Internet of Blockchains and fix the problem of blockchains existing
in silos, unable to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>In Tendermint, we have a globally known and predefined validator set.
Consensus proceeds</p>
<p>in three rounds, and at each round, more than ⅔ of the entire
validator set must vote for the proposed block in order to proceed to
the next round. Otherwise, if we don’t hear from validators within a
certain time, we count their vote as nil. And this reliance on a timeout
makes Tendermint a weakly synchronous protocol, rather than an
asynchronous one.</p>
<p>And because it’s BFT-based, Tendermint favors consistency over
availability. Validators wait for each other to vote or time out, and
come to consensus, before the state of the application is updated.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s run a little demo to see how the Tendermint consensus
engine runs at a high level.</p>
<p>On the right we have a state machine diagram for Tendermint. And on
the left we have our little demo network. If you’ve taken the first
course in the Blockchain Fundamentals program, Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies, then this diagram should be pretty familiar to
you.</p>
<p>Here’s how things work: at each new block height, a validator is
chosen to propose a new block.</p>
<p>We’ve circled this in red. If we were using Tendermint for
Proof-of-Stake, like how Cosmos does it, the validator would be chosen
at random based on their proportion of bonded token.</p>
<p>Then, in the first round, called “prevote”, the rest of the
validators can either prevote the block, or prevote nil.</p>
<p>Prevoting the block indicates that the validator marked the block as
valid. Prevoting nil either means that the validator marked the block as
invalid, or failed to respond within time – possibly due to network
timeout, power outage, or some other arbitrary reason. If we receive
more than ⅔ prevotes, that’s called a polka – hence the image of the two
people dancing in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>Then, in the next step is “precommit.” If a validator witnesses a ⅔
prevote for the block from the network and prevoted for the block, then
it precommits the block. Otherwise if the validator prevoted nil
previously because the block was invalid, or they just simply didn’t
prevote in time, then the validator precommits nil.</p>
<p>If ⅔ validators precommit the block, then the block is committed.
Else, a new voting round starts.</p>
<p>We start off in the New Height phase. In this step, we select a
validator to propose the next block. Tendermint does this with a
round-robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to
their voting power – which in the case of Proof-of-Stake is however much
every validator decided to stake.</p>
<p>Let’s say Rustie gets chosen as the proposer. In the “Propose” phase,
he proposes the next block. That’s the yellow block on top of his
name.</p>
<p>The next phase is to prevote. Since we have 5 validators, we need at
least 4 of us to prevote the block that he proposed in order to reach
the greater than ⅔ threshold.</p>
<p>So, we wait for a bit of time for all the prevotes to come in.
Remember that Tendermint is partially synchronous, so we stop waiting
after the timeout time has passed, and just take whatever prevotes we
have so far, and assume the rest are prevote nil.</p>
<p>Let’s say everyone prevotes for the block before time’s up, which
means that we have 5/5 prevotes for the block, and that’s more than
⅔.</p>
<p>And yay that’s a polka!</p>
<p>Alright, now we’re on the next phase, which is precommit. Everyone
who originally voted prevote block in the last phase should be voting
precommit block this time around.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>
<p>Uh-oh! Looks like there was a network partition, and both Nadir,
myself, and Nick are separated from the rest of the network. Maybe my
computer crashed and Nick’s neighborhood had a blackout.</p>
<p>Everyone precommits, and Derrick, Gloria, and Rustie all precommit
the block. Meanwhile, since no one’s heard from neither Nick nor myself
yet, and it’s past the timeout time, we count those votes as precommit
nil.</p>
<p>This time, we have ⅗ precommits for the block, which isn’t more than
⅔ of the total number of validators.</p>
<p>Alright, so since we didn’t get more than ⅔ precommits for the block,
we can’t commit the block Rustie proposed, so we have to go to a new
round.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Tendermint’s proposer selection algorithm is
round-robin, so it can’t choose me to propose again. The algorithm is
also proportional based on the amount of voting power we have, so let’s
say Derrick staked the second highest amount after Rustie, so he’s the
next to be able to propose a block.</p>
<p>That’s the yellow block on top of his name here.</p>
<p>And let’s say that I managed to reboot my crashed computer, and I’m
back online as a validator. This time around, if everyone prevotes and
precommits the block, all within time, and no one crashes or fails in
any other way, then we have ⅘, which is more than ⅔, so we could
potentially commit this next block.</p>
<p>And if Nick continues to be offline, his stake could be slashed.</p>
<p>Casper is a very intentional pun for being the spiritual successor of
GHOST. To preface, the GHOST protocol is Ethereum’s solution to its fast
block times. Fast block times, when compared to block propagation rates
and latency, mean that there will be more naturally occurring forks and
such. Valid blocks that are verified by part of the network might end up
being cast off because it lost the propagation race to another equally
valid block.</p>
<p>These castaway blocks are called uncle blocks, and while they might
not in the end be included in the longest chain, they do represent the
fact that there was some degree of computation done on them.</p>
<p>The GHOST protocol includes these uncle blocks into the calculation
of which chain has had the most cumulative work done on it: serving as a
fork resolving policy for miners.</p>
<p>Casper is a planned upgrade to Ethereum that’s an adaptation of some
of the principles of the GHOST protocol for Proof-of-Work into
Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>This upgrade from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake has been long in
planning, pretty much ever since the Ethereum yellow paper was written
in 2014, and evidence for which has been publicly viewable in the form
of the Ethereum ice age and difficulty bomb – both of which are
artificial limitations on the Ethereum software that have been purposely
placed in the protocol so as to force a hard fork years later.</p>
<p>The first steps to upgrade Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to
Proof-of-Stake will likely be first a Proof-of-Stake overlay on top of
the existing Proof-of-Work protocol. We’ll talk about this in the next
slide, but Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, an implementation of
Casper in the form of an Ethereum smart contract, is set for launch with
a 2-year plan and 1.2 million ether in funding.</p>
<p>There are two big implementations of Casper, each taking a different
approach. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, or Casper FFG, is a
Proof-of-Stake overlap on top of Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>It’s a chain and BFT-based Proof-of-Stake hybrid, and is taking a
step-wise approach to upgrading Ethereum, with the ultimate goal of
eventually casting away Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work scaffolding
entirely.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Casper the Friendly GHOST is a member of a family
of consensus protocols derived from a Correct by Construction, or CBC,
methodology. Sometimes you’ll hear Casper the Friendly GHOST being
referred to as CBC Casper. CBC means that this implementation</p>
<p>of Casper was designed from scratch to formally satisfy a certain
safety proof, so it’s correct by construction. It’s a pure
Proof-of-Stake protocol, not a hybrid like Casper FFG, and when in
implementation would require a much more drastic overhaul.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, Casper FFG is a Proof-of-Work and
Proof-of-Stake hybrid. It’s known colloquially as “Vitalik’s Casper”
since he’s the main advocate of this form of Casper.</p>
<p>Casper FFG is a Proof-of-Stake overlay on top of Proof-of-Work that –
as its name implies – is a tool that aims to fix finality in Ethereum.
In Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other Proof-of-Work blockchains, we rely
on the probabilistic finality of blocks. For example, in Bitcoin, we
assume that blocks are finalized with reasonable probability if that
block has more than six confirmations on top of it. Though it’s unlikely
for the block to be forked by a longer chain, the possibility will
always exist. Hence, the longest chain is never truly final in Bitcoin.
FFG attempts to take away that probabilistic finality from Proof-of-Work
systems.</p>
<p>In FFG, we carry on with Proof-of-Work as normal. However, every 50
blocks – called an “epoch” – we run a round of Proof-of-Stake, which
consists of prepare and commit phases, where validators vote on which
chain they believe to be canonical.</p>
<p>Each round of Proof-of-Stake at an epoch is called a checkpoint, and
checkpoints are first justified, and then if another checkpoint is built
on top of it, then that previous checkpoint is considered finalized. If
a block b is finalized, then the blockchain cannot reasonably revert
back to a time in history before block b.</p>
<p>This is also advantageous because we can now consider only the
justified chain rather than the entire Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Casper FFG also implements deposits and slashing conditions; we’ll
explain these in next week’s lecture about Proof-of-Stake and
cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Casper the Friendly Ghost is colloquially known as
Vlad’s Casper, named after Vlad Zamfir, cryptography researcher.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, it is designed from the ground up with a
correct-by-construction, or CBC, methodology, so it would be a more
drastic overhaul to the Ethereum network, aiming to redefine the
fundamentals of the protocol.</p>
<p>CBC Casper is a family of protocols that allow consensus on different
types of data, but all satisfy the same safety proof. Currently, there
are six consensus protocols that exist in the CBC family, which serve
purposes ranging from binary and ordinal consensus to list and
concurrent schedule consensus and blockchain consensus.</p>
<p>Instead of aiming for probabilistic finality, as with Bitcoin, CBC
Casper aims for absolute finality. Most Nakamoto Consensus networks,
because of the fork resolution policies they adopt, allow for extremely
historic chains to be overridden by even longer forks; a miner in
Iceland secretly mining an incredibly long blockchain which took more
computational power to produce could invalidate the entire Bitcoin
blockchain any day. This is because Nakamoto Consensus assumes that the
probability of such an event happening is incredibly low.</p>
<p>However, it’s never completely impossible.</p>
<p>CBC Casper, on the other hand, achieves eventual finality. This means
that, after some point in time, a block will eventually be finalized and
immutable. Though the time to finality could be unbounded, it is still a
finite amount of time. This is the subject of much present-day research,
and it may change even soon within the future. To best understand
cutting-edge developments such as these, it’s best to explore by
yourself for the best understanding.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get into details with so much theory to understand,
but recognizing the gist of the difference between probabilistic
finality and absolute finality and the differences between how the two
types of Casper achieve finality are the most important takeaways for
this particular section.</p>

<h3>Intro: Federated Consensus</h3>

<p>We’ve discussed voting consensus algorithms as solutions to
traditional distributed systems problems and Nakamoto consensus
algorithms as solutions to this new distributed system paradigm.</p>
<p>In the first, voting is done explicitly with a known set of nodes or
participants.</p>
<p>In the other, voting is done implicitly through the use of resources,
meaning that not all participants may be known.</p>
<p>One question you may have asked is whether there is any kind of
consensus mechanism to bridge the two together.</p>
<p>On one hand, you may want some explicit voting to avoid consuming any
kind of resource, possibly to avoid a carbon footprint.</p>
<p>On the other, you’re focused on censorship-resistance and want to
allow anyone to participate in consensus.</p>
<p>How can you achieve both, allowing anyone to join but not being
subjected to Sybil attacks?</p>
<p>One way to achieve this is Federated Consensus.</p>

<h3>Federated Consensus Overview</h3>

<p>Before diving into federated consensus, we’re going to refresh
ourselves with the definitions of all the terminology we’ve picked up
thus far.</p>
<p>Remember that a quorum in a distributed system is a set of nodes
sufficient to reach agreement.</p>
<p>In PBFT, that’s over two thirds of the voters.</p>
<p>We refer to this as a Byzantine agreement within a BFT consensus
algorithm.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re part of a decentralized distributed system, but you
can’t choose which nodes to trust.</p>
<p>How can you and your peers still come to consensus without relying on
a central party to dictate the truth?</p>
<p>This is where the concept of a federated Byzantine agreement comes
in.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a central actor to choose quorums for us or
decide the truth for us, we can individually select who we trust by
using a quorum slice.</p>
<p>This is a subset of a quorum that can convince a particular node, aka
you, of agreement.</p>
<p>Individual nodes can decide who to include within their quorum
slice.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re the purple node, the leftmost of this set of four
nodes.</p>
<p>You believe a crayon to be red.</p>
<p>The other nodes, who happen to be in your quorum slice, tell you that
the crayon is actually green.</p>
<p>Because you have decided to trust them, you change your opinion,
instead coming to consensus with them that the crayon is in fact
green.</p>
<p>You then celebrate and rejoice the ability of trust to permeate
through a decentralized network and allow you all to reach
consensus.</p>
<p>Hooray.</p>
<p>You might ask, “What’s the point of trusting these people?</p>
<p>Seems arbitrary to me.</p>
<p>Why not just trust a centralized entity if we’re handing out trust so
freely?”</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these aren’t the only nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Let’s say you only trust these four out of a thousand nodes, and you
only want to listen to them.</p>
<p>Of course, your follow-up question should be, “If I only trust these
four nodes out of thousands, how does the whole network reach
consensus?”</p>
<p>This is where quorum intersections come in.</p>
<p>By having overlapping sets of quorum slices, we can form a larger
quorum and ensure consensus throughout the entire network.</p>
<p>If all nodes share some individually selected trusted entities, then
the whole network will still come to the same decisions without
requiring a direct line of trust to any unknown node.</p>
<p>You can trust popular identities with a lot of reputation, nodes
which have been in the network for a while, or anyone else who you
believe deserves the right to influence your decision-making.</p>
<p>In the scenario where these quorum slices don’t line up, we get what
are known as disjoint quorums, the pitfall of federated consensus.</p>
<p>If this happens, then there is no way to guarantee that all actors
will come to consensus.</p>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about consensus in theory; how’s about going
through an example?</p>
<p>Let’s say that Rustie, Derrick, and I (Nadir) are trying to figure
out what to get for lunch again.</p>
<p>But this time, our friend group is ever expanding, meaning that new people 
will join during the day.</p>
<p>Since we’re nice people, we’re open to letting others join in, but there’s 
always trust issues when meeting people for the first time.</p>
<p>Rustie suggests pizza, his favorite dish, making the suggestion to Derrick 
and myself.</p>
<p>We two, however, know of a secret deal for $1 burgers today.</p>
<p>Rustie, also a fan of burgers,</p>
<p>And also acknowledging the value of the discount, cedes to our
preference and decides on burgers as well.</p>
<p>The three of us celebrate for coming to consensus.</p>
<p>Saroj notices our cheeriness and asks to join our friend group for
lunch.</p>
<p>However, he doesn’t trust Rustie for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Rustie tried to get pizza on $1 burger day.</p>
<p>Because of this, Derrick and I decide to form a quorum slice with
Saroj, meaning we all influence each other’s decision making.</p>
<p>Trust is beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Gloria, seeing how much our love has flourished, also wants to join
us.</p>
<p>However, she only trusts Rustie and Derrick.</p>
<p>Rustie and Derrick also trust her, so they form a quorum slice as
well.</p>
<p>And tada, we now have two new overlapping quorum slices with Derrick
in the middle.</p>
<p>Including the first quorum slice, there are a total of three quorum
slices.</p>
<p>The intersections are the most crucial parts, as those ensure that
decisions made within individual quorums propagate to the other parts of
the network.</p>

<h3>Federated Consensus Implementations</h3>

<p>Because of the way that Federated Byzantine Agreement functions, it
offers a few nice properties.</p>
<p>First, like other blockchain consensus algorithms, it offers
decentralized control.</p>
<p>No one decides the quorums – except the individuals.</p>
<p>On top of that, the latency is low, as consensus can be achieved with
a relatively low cost of computation.</p>
<p>Finally, trust is flexible.</p>
<p>No node has to trust anyone who they don’t want to trust, instead
only choosing to listen to the closest and trusted peers.</p>
<p>The first cryptocurrency to leverage this consensus algorithm is
Ripple, which refers to itself as a real-time gross settlement
system.</p>
<p>Ripple targets big financial institutions, offering quick and
decentralized cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Rather than having to create a new branch of trust between banks for
every international</p>
<p>payment, sometimes taking up to days, the Ripple network allows these
institutions to self-select trusted peers and maintain a collective
history of transactions.</p>
<p>Naturally, Ripple is a somewhat permissioned ledger, as banks need to
be authenticated before getting access to the Ripple ledger.</p>
<p>A note, Ripple is a distributed ledger but not necessarily a blockchain system.</p>
<p>This means that the data structure holding information is not a blockchain, 
but many of the assumptions and goals of the system are similar to that of well-
known blockchain projects.</p>
<p>This image quickly represents the makeup of the Ripple network.</p>
<p>Validating nodes participate in consensus, while tracking nodes maintain the 
history.</p>
<p>Stellar is the public version of Ripple.</p>
<p>It’s actually a software fork of Ripple, meaning that the codebase for 
Stellar broke off from Ripple.</p>
<p>However, it split off to focus on bringing federated consensus to the common 
people.</p>
<p>This platform connects all types of institutions and users, from banks to 
non-profit institutions.</p>
<p>It aims to make wealth accessible.</p>
<p>As we saw in the federated consensus overview, this diagram represents the 
process by which someone in the Stellar network might come to a decision on 
what they want to have for lunch.</p>

Consensus comic strips.</p>

<h2>Week 1 - Distributed Systems</h2>

<h3>I. Distributed Systems</h3>

<p>Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain, a ledger that is
maintained by a <strong>distributed system</strong>, or a network of
independent <strong>nodes</strong> connected by <strong>message
channels</strong> that move information between them. A critical aspect
of a distributed system is the way in which these nodes, which are
unknown and untrusting of each other, come to agreement, or consensus.
In the case of Bitcoin, the network needs to agree on the number of
bitcoins each individual owns, and of all transactions being made.</p>
<p>Distributed systems remove the need for trust in potentially
unreliable parties; instead, we can trust the mathematics and the
correct operation of these systems. If one of the nodes crashes or is
corrupted by malicious entities, we can still protect our information
and services by relying on previously set protocols that withstand these
failures.</p>
<p>There are 3 key components of distributed systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Components in the system process information <strong>concurrently</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>Each node maintains its own clock; there is <strong>no global clock</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>Protocols<strong> protect against potential failure</strong> of individual components</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A distributed system is considered “<strong>correct</strong>” if it comes to 
consensus on an answer – given an input, the nodes must agree on an output.</p>
<p>To prove the correctness of a distributed system, we use the scheme designed 
by Lamport. The scheme says that a system is correct if two things are true:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Safety:</strong> It doesn’t do bad things! </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Liveness:</strong> It will eventually do good things. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure correctness, we use <strong>consensus algorithms</strong>.
There are 3 requirements of any correct consensus algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Validity:</strong> any value agreed upon must be proposed by one of the processes</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Agreement:</strong> all non-faulty processes must agree on the same value</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Termination:</strong> all non-faulty nodes eventually decide</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that validity and agreement are safety properties while termination is a liveness property.</p>

  alt="CAP Theorem Venn diagram highlighting intersections of Consistency and 
   Availability with the letters CA, Consistency and Partition Tolerance with 
   the letters CP, and Availability and Partition Tolerances with the letters AP." />

<p>The CAP Theorem states that any distributed system can only achieve 2
of the following 3 properties at any given time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> every node provides the most recent state 
    of the system</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Availability:</strong> every node has constant read and write 
    access</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Partition Tolerance:</strong> ability to function in spite of 
    partitions in the network, where a <strong>partition</strong> is the inability 
	for two or more nodes to communicate with each other; this is almost a given 
	for any distributed system</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to understand there aren’t black and white tradeoffs
between these three properties – compromises can be made. </p>

<ol start="3" type="I">
  <li><h3>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h3></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Byzantine nodes</strong> may act maliciously or arbitrarily.
Achieving consensus when ⅓ or more of the nodes are Byzantine nodes is
impossible.</p>
<p>There are two types of <strong>faults</strong> that may be produced
by Byzantine nodes, where faults are deviants from protocol:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Fail-stop:</strong> a node can crash and not return values</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Byzantine:</strong> in addition to above, nodes can also send 
    incorrect/corrupted values; all deviations from protocol fall under this category</p></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4" type="I">
  <h3><li>Voting Based Consensus Mechanisms</li></h3>
</ol>

<p>These mechanisms allow nodes to come to consensus when no more than ⅓
of the nodes are Byzantine nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Paxos</strong> - Consensus mechanism inspired by the Paxon
parliament, who used the Paxos algorithm to pass decrees and make sure
everyone on the island was in consensus. Assumes nodes do not try to
subvert protocol; only works for fail-stop, no byzantine failure
tolerance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Proposer:</strong> proposes legislation/changes to current state</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Acceptor:</strong> decides whether to accept proposed legislation</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Learner:</strong> learns and distributes changes to mass audience</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Quorum:</strong> Majority of acceptors, any two quorums must overlap</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Raft</strong> - Leader based approach designed to be more
understandable than Paxos, easier to implement; i.e. JP Morgan’s Quorum
(enterprise version of Ethereum).</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>One and only one leader:</strong> communicates with client directly, &gt; responsible for log replication on other servers, leads until &gt; fails or disconnects</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Leader election:</strong> leader sends heartbeats to signal it is online &gt; and functioning; if no heartbeats are received the first node to &gt; realize a lack of leader becomes the new leader</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</strong> - fast, handles F faults in a system with 3F + 1 nodes, BFT-NFS implementation only 3% slower than standard unreplicated NFS</p>
<p>Operates using 3 phases: </p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pre-prepare:</strong>  the primary node sends out pre-prepare messages to &gt; everyone in the network; a node accepts the pre-prepare message so &gt; long as its valid.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Prepare:</strong> If a node accepts a pre-prepare message, it follows up &gt; by sending out a prepare message to everyone else; prepare &gt; messages are accepted by receiving nodes so long as they’re valid, &gt; again, based on sequence number, signature, and other metadata; A &gt; node is considered “prepared” if it has seen the original request &gt; from the primary node, has pre-prepared, and has seen 2F prepare &gt; messages that match its pre-prepare – making for 2F + 1 prepares.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Prepare:</strong> If a node accepts a pre-prepare message, it follows up &gt; by sending out a prepare message to everyone else; prepare &gt; messages are accepted by receiving nodes so long as they’re valid, &gt; again, based on sequence number, signature, and other metadata; A &gt; node is considered “prepared” if it has seen the original request &gt; from the primary node, has pre-prepared, and has seen 2F prepare &gt; messages that match its pre-prepare – making for 2F + 1 prepares.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Commit:</strong> If a node receives F+ 1 valid commit messages, then they &gt; carry out the client request and then finally send out the reply &gt; to the client. The client waits for F + 1 of the same reply. Since &gt; we allow for at most F faults, we need to wait for at least F + 1, &gt; and this ensures the response to be valid.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>V. Nakamoto Consensus</h3>

<p>Used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Whereas the voting based
consensus mechanisms covered above use explicit voting, Nakamoto
consensus uses <strong>implicit voting</strong> i.e. voting based on
lottery-selection and earned voting power.</p>
<p>Nakamoto consensus is <strong>very robust</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Anyone can join or leave the network at any time</p></li>
  <li><p>Anyone can even send corrupted messages to others</p></li>
  <li><p>Any user can have as many virtual identities/key pairs, as they want</p></li>
  <li><p>To prevent unfair voting from anyone who dishonestly creates &gt; multiple identities, voting power must be made scarce, done by &gt; tying voting power to a scarce resource such as power or &gt; electricity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each Nakamoto Consensus protocol must have a set of rules defining
how to choose the most valid state of the network, such as
the<strong> longest chain</strong> policy in Bitcoin and many
cryptocurrencies. This is because each node in the Nakamoto consensus
network gets to choose its own state, and try to convince others of its
validity.</p>
<p>Multiple forms of Nakamoto Consensus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Proof of Work</strong> - current blockchain standard, led by bitcoin and &gt; followed by most networks, led to mining craze and rapid &gt; acquisition of computing hardware</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Proof of Stake</strong> - experimental protocol to end electricity drain &gt; by staking tokens, can mine or validate block transactions &gt; according to how many tokens staked</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Proof of Activity</strong> - a proof of work and proof of stake hybrid &gt; protocol</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Proof of Capacity/Space</strong> - memory-hard PoW, allocating amount of &gt; memory or disk to solve a challenge</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Proof of Burn</strong> - like Proof-of-Stake, except staked coins are &gt; burned</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><ol start="6" type="I">
  <li>Proof-of-Stake</h3></li>
</ol>

<p>With proof-of-stake, <strong>validators</strong> are stakeholders
with voting power proportional to the <strong>economic
stake</strong> they have locked up. The assumption here is that someone
with more stake is more incentivized to do things that will benefit the
system and thus increase their economic stake.</p>
<p><strong>Chain-based PoS</strong> chooses availability
while <strong>Byzantine Fault Tolerant PoS</strong> chooses
consistency.</p>

<h4>Weaknesses of PoS versus PoW:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><p>PoS is susceptible to corruption if over 33% of the network are &gt; malicious actors, whereas PoW requires over 50% malicious actors</p></li>
  <li><p>PoS tends to lead to a rich-become-richer problem where those who &gt; stake substantial portions of the total network will grow in &gt; proportion due to higher likelihood of being selected, and thus &gt; rewarded</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the larger players grow past 33% of network, poses a threat &gt; to validity</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>VII. Federated Consensus</h3>

<p>Federated consensus allows us to achieve explicit voting and
censorship resistance, so that we can allow anyone to join but also
protect the network against Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>If you don’t trust certain nodes in the quorum, we can avoid having a
central party choose the quorum for us by using a quorum slice, or
subsets of a quorum that a particular node can trust. A <strong>quorum
slice</strong> allows us to individually choose who we trust, and when
multiple quorum slices overlap, we form <strong>quorum
intersections</strong> and thus a larger quorum.</p>
<p>Federated consensus is powerful because of its decentralized control,
low latency, and flexibility towards trust. Popular implementations of
federated consensus
include <strong>Ripple</strong> and <strong>Stellar</strong>. </p>

<h1 id="ch2">Securing Incentives: Cryptoeconomics &amp; Proof-of-Stake - Week 2</h1>

<p>Welcome to week 2 of CS198.2x, Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>This week, we’ll be diving into an analysis of cryptoeconomics now that you 
have an understanding of distributed systems and consensus mechanisms, particularly 
in the context of blockchain.</p>
<p>You might have heard about cryptoeconomics before as an active area 
of research, but what does cryptoeconomics actually mean, and what significance 
does it have when dealing with blockchain?</p>
<p>Cryptoeconomics exists at a higher level than what we’ve covered so far in 
class, representing a fundamentally different way to analyze blockchain systems.</p>
<p>It’s a high-level design abstraction, used to analyze, incentivize, and secure 
decisions for peers in a decentralized system.</p>
<p>Through understanding cryptoeconomics, we can understand and prove qualities 
about a blockchain system’s architecture without getting distracted by unnecessary 
details.</p>

<h3>Intro: Cryptoeconomics</h3>

<p>The world is full of decisions.</p>
<p>On a daily basis: when you wake up, go to work, take an online course, you’ve 
observed the state of the universe and come to some conclusion about the next 
move you need to make.</p>
<p>But what are the components of a decision?</p>
<p>And how do you ensure the decision is not modified later?</p>
<p>There are two steps to making a decision, and these two steps are critical to 
understanding cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>The first step is to analyze the situation – the facts presented to you – 
and use judgement to come to a decision.</p>
<p>Every decision you make should be the best decision possible for you, 
according to rational choice theory.</p>
<p>This is where economics comes into play.</p>
<p>The second step is to secure that decision.</p>
<p>In the physical world, all decisions we make are “secured,” or made permanent, 
by physical devices.</p>
<p>Dollar bills for expressing a payment, handwritten signatures to generate a 
commitment.</p>
<p>However, in the virtual world, we lose access to all these pleasantries.</p>
<p>How does it work in the virtual world?</p>
<p>The second step is to secure that decision.</p>
<p>You need to ensure that your decision will not be manipulated by any observers.</p>
<p>This is secured through cryptography.</p>
<p>Cryptoeconomics is the analysis of virtual decision-making, from incentivizing 
actors to make the best decisions for a given goal from ensuring that the decisions’ 
history is maintained honestly and forever.</p>

<h3>Cryptoeconomics</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%;"
  title="What is Cryptoeconomics: Virtual Decision Making"
  alt="What is Cryptoeconomics: Virtual Decision Making." />

<p>Cryptoeconomics aims to understand virtual decision-making by
unknown, untrusting peers.</p>
<p>If that’s too abstract for you, think Bitcoin: several different
people are trying to come to agreement on a history of transactions.</p>
<p>They’re all incentivized to exploit any possibilities which might
bring them more profit.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto’s goal in designing Bitcoin, then, is to remove any
possibilities of actors unfairly getting more profit than they deserve,
however they chose to define “deserve.”</p>
<p>One could say a goal of Bitcoin would be to ensure actors get rewards
proportional to the amount of computational power put into the
network.</p>
<p>We know from our previous course, Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrencies,
that there are several ways to extract profit maliciously due to
incentive misalignments.</p>
<p>To prevent inequitable behavior, it’s necessary to determine how to
construct an ecosystem in which actors are incentivized to do things
which help the greater good, and in which they can make those decisions
securely.</p>
<p>Let’s break down how decisions are made, and let’s start with
time.</p>
<p>Time is distinguished by three things: the past, present, and
future.</p>
<p>In every moment, changes are happening because people are making
decisions.</p>
<p>In the physical world, as mentioned in the intro, these decisions
permanently change the world.</p>
<p>To replicate this in the virtual world, we need to first ensure that
good changes are made, then make changes permanent.</p>
<p>Because this is a virtual world, every construction to make these all
possible will be virtual!</p>
<p>What tools do we have to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Cryptography, first and foremost, is a secure information to make
sure that decisions are not modified once made.</p>
<p>Every time an actor makes a decision in a decentralized network, they
secure that decision with cryptography.</p>
<p>Examples include cryptographic signatures for authentication and
hashes for immutability.</p>
<p>Hence, cryptography is used to secure the past.</p>
<p>Economics, on the other hand, informs us how to design our system to
ensure that actors make decisions in line with the goals of the greater
good.</p>
<p>By understanding the incentives of each actor, it’s possible to
reduce the prevalence of game theoretical attacks.</p>
<p>Examples include the block reward in Bitcoin and the cost of mining
to deter Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>In other words, economics is used to secure the future.</p>
<p>By combining these two perspectives, we can do some fascinating
things.</p>
<p>Before we talk about those things, however, we want to go over some
basic cryptographic and economic “primitives,” or building blocks, which
we will then use to analyze and construct some examples of
protocols.</p>

<h3>Intro: Cryptography</h3>

<p>Usually, when you hear the word cryptography, you think of hackers
online disguising their identities and sending secret messages, or
perhaps the Enigma machine developed and cracked during World War
II.</p>
<p>These are all applications of cryptography, but what is the root
meaning of the term?</p>
<p>Cryptography’s goal is to secure the integrity and confidentiality of
information.</p>
<p>That’s all it does.</p>
<p>The implications of this goal, however, are broad, meaning that
cryptography is used all over the world for information security.</p>
<p>Note that cryptography is primarily useful in adversarial
environments.</p>
<p>There’s no point trying to keep information hidden and secure without
the potential for failures or attackers.</p>
<p>In distributed systems with unknown, potentially adversarial actors
like blockchain networks, cryptography is fundamentally important to
ensuring that information is kept secret and safe whenever
necessary.</p>

<h3>Origins of Cryptography</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 51. origins of cryptography (88) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image051.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Origins of Cryptography"
  alt="Origins of Cryptography." />

<p>Before we talk about the specifics of cryptography, let’s go over
some situations which gave birth to the field of cryptography.</p>
<p>A famous example you may be familiar with is the Caesar cipher.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar, a famous leader and general of the Roman Empire, would
often send messages with sensitive information to his fellow generals,
such as information about an impending attack from an enemy.</p>
<p>Of course, this information could be misused if it got into the wrong
hands.</p>
<p>What would be the ideal scenario, then?</p>
<p>It’s one in which Caesar sends a message to his recipient, but only
he and the recipient can read it.</p>
<p>Anyone else trying to understand the information would fail.</p>
<p>Is there any way to achieve this?</p>
<p>Well, there was term developed in the last half a millenium to mean
precisely this, known as “encryption,” the process of transforming
information into an unintelligible intermediary piece of information
which can be transformed back into its original state with
decryption.</p>
<p>(This is different from cryptographic hash functions, as the input is
not meant to be inverted by anyone, after the function is applied.)</p>
<p>Encryption schemes have two functions in use: the encryption
function, and the decryption function.</p>
<p>The encryption function will take some meaningful data and turn it
into something illegible.</p>
<p>The decryption function, on the other hand, will take the illegible
information and make it meaningful.</p>
<p>How can we use this?</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a piece of information, known as x, which we want
to keep secret.</p>
<p>If we encrypt x, it becomes E(x).</p>
<p>Anyone who reads E(x) should not be able to figure out what the value
of x is.</p>
<p>In other words, they do not know the decryption function.</p>
<p>Let’s say Alice sends E(x) to Bob, and Bob has the decryption
function.</p>
<p>This means that he can run the decryption function on E(x) to get the
original input, x.</p>
<p>In other words, D(E(x)) should always equal x.</p>
<p>As long as only trusted third parties have access to a decryption
function, only they can read the encrypted information.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to Caesar ciphers?</p>
<p>Caesar designed a scheme to perform exactly this.</p>
<p>A Caesar cipher is meant to be used on text.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image on the right, each input corresponds to
some output letter.</p>
<p>Caeser ciphers rely on what is known as substitution, meaning that
every letter is replaced with a different one.</p>
<p>Let’s go through the process of how a Caesar cipher works.</p>
<p>First, a random number is chosen.</p>
<p>This random number represents the amount of spaces the letter will be
shifted.</p>
<p>It is called a “key” because it unlocks the secret message, making it
the secret which allows someone to figure out the decryption scheme.</p>
<p>If the key were publicly known, then the Caeser cipher could be
easily broken.</p>
<p>It is said that Caesar used the key 3 for all his ciphers, as
demonstrated in the diagram.</p>
<p>In this section, however, we’ll consider that any key between 1 and
25 can be chosen.</p>
<p>(Since there are only 26 letters, there’s no point in choosing
anything higher, since we’d just end up looping around to where we
started.)</p>
<p>Once the key is chosen, we now know how to algorithmically generate
an output from any given input.</p>
<p>We then take our specific input, run it through the encryption
function which shifts each letter over some number of times equal to the
key, and spits out the scrambled result.</p>
<p>This encrypted message has no discernable meaning.</p>
<p>The only use is to be decrypted later.</p>
<p>This encrypted message can be sent to others safely now, assuming no
one else but the recipient knows how to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>When the recipient receives the message, they will use the key to
recover the meaning from the previously illegible information.</p>
<p>In this case, decrypting the message requires shifting every letter
in the opposite direction as the encryption function by the same amount,
the value of the key.</p>
<p>Now, the recipient has the information, but no one else does.</p>
<p>Voila!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this scheme does not imply anything about the
integrity of the message or guarantee of its delivery.</p>
<p>If this message were a note carried by a bird, there’s nothing to
stop someone from shooting the bird and tearing up the note, or even
changing a few letters during transit.</p>
<p>This means that all we have is the guarantee that the information
will not be read by an attacker, but they may be able to mutate or even
destroy the message entirely.</p>
<p>Those other guarantees might be secured by other cryptographic or
computer science measures, but those are out of scope for this
lecture.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a scenario in which we might actually use a Caesar
cipher.</p>
<p>Let’s say that, in 69 BCE, Nadir and I are generals in the Roman
army.</p>
<p>He wants to send me a message.</p>
<p>Nadir and I are both good friends with Caesar, so we’re familiar with
his famous encryption scheme.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, aliens played a big part in building the cities of
Rome.</p>
<p>During their trip, they gave Nadir and myself a great deal of
knowledge about blockchain.</p>
<p>We decide to leverage that during this process.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, he wants to send me the word “blockchain.”</p>
<p>How can he use the Caesar cipher to protect his message from foreign
eyes?</p>
<p>Some time when Nadir and I met in person, we decided to use the
number 21 as our key, since Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million
bitcoins.</p>
<p>This means that our table would look something like the image
below:</p>
<p>As you’ll see, there are two rows of 26 letters.</p>
<p>In the top row are the letters A through Z as normal.</p>
<p>In the bottom row, every letter has been shifted to the right 21
times.</p>
<p>Instead of starting with A, this row instead starts with F and ends
with E. Essentially, the 1st letter now corresponds to the 6th letter in
the alphabet, the 2nd letter to the 7th, and so on.</p>
<p>So now that we’ve generated our table, how can we use it?</p>
<p>Let’s try plugging the word “blockchain” into the table and see what
happens.</p>
<p>The first step is to locate the letter “B” in the top row of
letters.</p>
<p>Once we’ve done that, we can then use the table to figure out which
letter it should correspond to.</p>
<p>As you can see, it happens to be G.</p>
<p>We go ahead and append that letter to our new encrypted message.</p>
<p>With the second letter, “L”, we go ahead and do the same thing.</p>
<p>We locate the letter…</p>
<p>… locate the corresponding letter, “Q”, …</p>
<p>… and add that to our list.</p>
<p>If we skip ahead to the end, this is what our final result looks
like.</p>
<p>I’m not even going to try to pronounce that because it makes
absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what we’re trying to do!</p>
<p>We want it to make no sense.</p>
<p>Nadir can now send this message to me without fear of anyone else
reading it.</p>
<p>Let’s say Gloria, a traitor general giving secrets to the enemy,
happens to intercept this message.</p>
<p>What can she do with this message?</p>
<p>She can burn or corrupt it, but she can’t read it.</p>
<p>Perhaps she doesn’t want to mess with the message, since that could
inform Nadir and myself of a traitor, so she decides not to do
anything.</p>
<p>By using the Caesar cipher, we’ve foiled her attempts at betraying
the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>I’ve now received the encrypted message.</p>
<p>How can I turn it back into the original message?</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I need to decrypt it with the decryption
function.</p>
<p>In the case of the Caesar cipher, I’d be using the key to make the
function.</p>
<p>Only this time, instead of shifting letters to the right, I’d shift
them to the left.</p>
<p>In other words, I’m undoing the shift that Nadir did on the original
message.</p>
<p>Again, I plug the messages into the table, and I get the original
word, blockchain.</p>
<p>Success!</p>
<p>Nadir and I, as an added layer of obfuscation outside the Caesar
cipher, happen to use blockchain as a keyword to mean “prepare your
defenses,” meaning that he knows of an impending attack on my fortress,
possibly due to aliens.</p>
<p>I set up my defenses and am safe from the enemy attack, all thanks to
encryption.</p>
<p>The Caesar cipher wasn’t the oldest kind of cryptography, nor was it
the last.</p>
<p>There are several other examples, from ancient Egypt to modern
life.</p>
<p>The Enigma machine, cracked by English hero and computer scientist
Alan Turing, was developed by the German army during World War II to
make messages indecipherable during transmission.</p>
<p>The machine was possibly the most complex encryption scheme on the
planet at the time.</p>
<p>During World War I and World War II, America also devised a way to
keep messages private.</p>
<p>However, instead of coming up with a code, they chose to seek help
from bilingual Native Americans from various tribes, known during the
wars as “code talkers.”</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of Native American languages and scarcity
of speakers, they were asked to serve as communication
intermediaries.</p>
<p>A general would safely give a message to a code talker, and the code
talker would translate then relay the message over a long distance to
another one.</p>
<p>Notice that the translation from English to the code talker’s
language, such as Navajo or Cherokee, represents the encryption
step.</p>
<p>The second code talker would receive the encrypted message and
translate it back to English for a second general to hear.</p>
<p>To tie this back to cryptography in cryptoeconomics, you can tell
that each of these devices are used after a decision is made, such as
crafting a message or file for delivery.</p>
<p>Cryptography in all these examples focuses on securing the decision
decided upon by some entity.</p>
<p>We’ll now go over some of the primitives in cryptography, which serve
as building blocks for larger devices to accomplish this decision
securing.</p>

<h3>Cryptographic Primitives</h3>

<p>In the next few slides, we’ll be presenting various cryptographic
primitives that will be relevant in this lecture and in future ones, so
pay close attention, and try to imagine situations where this primitive
might be useful for accomplishing some goal.</p>
<p>One of the primitives you should be familiar with by now is the
cryptographic hash function, which we shorten for convenience to hash
function or just hash.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that cryptographic hash functions are NOT the
same as typical hash functions, even though we’re shortening the name
for convenience.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, cryptographic hash functions are used to
fingerprint a piece of information.</p>
<p>This is done through preimage, second preimage, and collision
resistance, as explained in the previous course, Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example where hashes are important for securing a
blockchain network.</p>
<p>And we’ll do this by taking a sneak peak back at how Bitcoin’s tamper
evidence system works.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Merkle Root.</p>
<p>By using hash functions, we can capture the identity of the
information without revealing anything about the information.</p>
<p>For example, if we take the hash of a transaction, the idea is that
the transaction data will no longer match with the hash, the identifier,
if modified, also implying that no other transaction will match this
identifier as well.</p>
<p>The Merkle Root effectively does this over every transaction in the
block.</p>
<p>Second is the previous block hash, which points to the previous block
in the blockchain.</p>
<p>This makes the block permanently attached to the previous one.</p>
<p>By doing this throughout the blockchain, the chain becomes
immutable.</p>
<p>Anyone trying to manipulate the history will corrupt that block and
anything onwards.</p>
<p>Third is the block header hash, which needs to satisfy the
requirement of being below a certain target value.</p>
<p>This is the part of the design which enforces Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>Miners repeatedly try hashes until the block header hash is
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Without the properties of hashes, it would be difficult to enforce
these restrictions.</p>
<p>Another cryptographic primitive is the digital signature, used to
cryptographically prove your identity.</p>
<p>Each individual has a public facing identity and a private piece of
information used to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>We recall from Bitcoin the public and private key scheme used by each
individual entity to receive and send bitcoins.</p>
<p>Through using digital signatures, we assume each real-world entity
can have at least one virtual representation of themselves, and that no
one else can pretend to be that person.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for information to be lost in transit or in
storage.</p>
<p>Is there a way to protect that information without duplicating it
repeatedly?</p>
<p>This is what erasure codes attempt to solve.</p>
<p>Erasure codes construct an algorithm to add additional pieces of
information to a piece of data.</p>
<p>Even if some pieces of data are lost, you can still reconstruct the
original information if you have enough pieces of data left.</p>
<p>This is used frequently in memory replication protocols, such as
RAID, as a way of ensuring data preservation and security.</p>
<p>Timelocks are a special kind of encryption.</p>
<p>Timelocks allow for a message to be easily encrypted but take a
longer amount of time to decrypt.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a built-in delay before the information can
be retrieved.</p>
<p>In addition, it is highly difficult to find ways to speed up the
decryption of this information in parallel, meaning that putting
multiple computers together won’t decrease the delay time.</p>
<p>This will allow us to ensure that data is not opened for some amount
of time.</p>
<p>The equation on the right demonstrates how we can do this.</p>
<p>The value of n in the exponent is proportional to how much time it
takes to decode, allowing us to easily adjust the functionality of this
timelock to our specifications.</p>

<h3>Game Theory</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 52. economic incentives: rewards and penalties (98) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  style="width:45%;"
  title="Economic Incentives: Rewards and Penalties"
  alt="Economic Incentives: Rewards and Penalties." />

<p>In Game Theory, we aim to deduce how an actor will act in a given
situation. There are a number of factors that will affect the actor’s
choice: these include the actions of the other actors in the situation,
and the rewards and penalties associated with each possible outcome.</p>
<p>Thus, the rewards and penalties, or economic incentives, in a game
can be manipulated to change the actor’s choice of action. The most
commonly used economic incentives in blockchain are tokens, units of
protocol defined cryptocurrency given out to miners and privileges,
decision making rights miners can charge for.</p>
<p>For the purpose of our analysis, we will assume that the underlying
objective for actors in our crypto economic games is to maximize their
profit, which is equals their revenues minus their costs. The economic
incentives at hand here then, are that we use must change the actor’s
expected profit outcome in order to change the actor’s choice.</p>
<p>We can incentivize actors to act a certain way using the carrot and
stick theory, where we offer carrot rewards like increasing token
balances or privileges for good behavior, and offer stick punishments
like decreasing tokens or privileges for bad behavior.</p>
<p>Another method to incentivize actors to do the right thing is by
using a security margin.</p>
<p>A cryptoeconomic security margin is an amount of money, X, such that
either some requirement G is satisfied or all actors violating G will be
poorer by at least X. Actors must decide to either lose X sum of money
or abide by the rules of the game.</p>
<p>To enforce acceptance of the security margin, we use something called
a cryptoeconomic proof, where messages signed by the actor are
interpreted as confirmations of their decisions, that either some
proposal is true or the miner agrees to suffer that economic loss.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back now, and think about how we can deduce how
actors will act in situations given these incentive structures. To solve
this problem, we’ll be using the game theory model of Normal Form Games.
Normal form games have a set of N actors who each have a set of A
possible actions. Their expected payoff from the game depends on the
outcome.</p>
<p>In the Uncoordinated Choice Model, actors must make decisions without
coordinating with other actors. While each actor will know the
incentives and best response strategy of every other actor, actors
cannot work together to decide upon their actions. Thus all the actors
in such a game have separate incentives. To motivate correct behavior, a
good incentive mechanism would set the security margin to be higher than
each of the individual incentives.</p>
<p>The fixed collection of actions the players of a game will ultimately
take is known as the Nash Equilibrium. The Nash Equilibrium is the state
from which no actor can change their action to receive a better
outcome.</p>
<p>Let’s now take this abstract theory and implement it in a real life
situation.</p>
<p>Suppose a situation in which there are two prisoners, Prisoner A and
Prisoner B, who were recently detained for robbing a bank.</p>
<p>The inspector separates the criminals into two different rooms and
interrogates them.</p>
<p>To each, he gives the choice to turn the other prisoner in, or remain
silent. If both prisoners remain silent, they will both suffer 5 years
in prison.</p>
<p>If one prisoner remains silent but the other prisoner turns him in,
the silent prisoner will bear responsibility for the whole crime and
face 20 years in prison, while the snitch will face 0 years in prison.
Finally, if both prisoners decide to turn the other in, they will both
face 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Since the prisoners are separated, they must make the decision
individually and cannot coordinate with the other. So what will the
prisoners decide?</p>
<p>If Prisoner B chooses to remain silent, Prisoner A will choose to
speak, because in doing so, he can get 0 years of prison time instead of
the 5 years he would get if he also remained silent.</p>
<p>If instead Prisoner B chooses to speak, then Prisoner A will again
choose to also speak, because the 10 year penalty of them both speaking
is still less than the 20 year penalty of Prisoner A remaining silent
while Prisoner B speaks.</p>
<p>We can deduce the same best response strategies for Prisoner B. Thus
we are left with a situation where given any action of the opponent,
each prisoner benefits more from speaking than from remaining
silent.</p>
<p>This outcome is our Nash Equilibrium. Given the state where both
prisoners speak, neither prisoner can change only their own decision to
get a better sentence.</p>
<p>This is called the Prisoner’s Dilemma, where both prisoners end up
with a 10 year sentence, even though they could have both gotten only a
5 year sentence if they had both remained silent!</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at an example where there are two Nash
Equilibria. Here’s the traditional example.</p>
<p>Suppose a man and a woman are deciding where to go on a date, boxing
or shopping. If they both go boxing, the man will be slightly happier
than the woman. If they both go shopping, the woman will be slightly
happier than the man. However, if they choose different options, neither
will be happy at all because they won’t go on a date together.</p>
<p>Thus both going boxing and both going shopping are the Nash
Equilibria from which no one character can change their decision to
receive a better payoff. Since there are two such equilibrium outcomes,
the two agents must coordinate to align their actions to each other and
pick one of the outcomes. In coordinated games, the actors in a protocol
are controlled by the same agent.</p>
<p>We’re now going to look at another example of such games in the
context of cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>Schellingcoin is a thought problem Vitalik came up with to teach
principles of cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>In this example, suppose A is the objectively right way to orient a
toilet paper roll.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a sensor oracle, and you must answer the question,
what is the right way to orient a toilet paper roll? Well, let’s go back
to choice models to see how to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>You will get a reward, P, only if you vote with the majority. Here
there are 2 Nash Equilibria.</p>
<p>Everyone could vote A, and you could vote A and get the reward. Or
everyone could vote B, and you could also vote B and get the same
reward, even if B is the wrong answer.</p>
<p>However, in this scenario we will assume that players will be
incentivized to vote the true answer, A, because they want to vote with
the majority and believe others will choose the same, given the same
choices.</p>
<p>Someone who wants the oracle to converge on the wrong answer can do
so using the Bribing Attacker Game. Let’s say Nadir is voting now and he
saw the majority was going to vote for A. However, I really want him to
vote for B. I can promise Nadir that I will pay him P+ε if and only if
Nadir votes for B but the majority votes for A. Nadir, under the belief
that he is the only one who got this deal, will vote for B thinking
everyone else will vote for A. However, I meanwhile have been giving
every single actor the same deal, and each person thinks like Nadir to
switch their vote to B, not knowing everyone else is doing the same.</p>
<p>In the end, everyone votes B, and I, the attacker, do not have to pay
any money in bribes since I only agreed to paying the bribe if each
actor voted B while the majority voted A.</p>
<p>Now, some attacks review, with a particular focus on economic
incentives. These were covered in our first course, go back and take
that course if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>Let’s review an attack called feather forking. Suppose Gloria is a
large mining pool. To carry out this attack, Gloria would announce that
she will attempt to fork every time she sees a transaction from me,
Rustie. But, she also announces that she would give up after the block
containing my block has k confirmations. Unlike the attack where one
attempts to fork forever, punitive forking, this attack can still work
even if you have less than 51% of the mining power.</p>
<p>What chance does Gloria, the mining pool, actually have at
successfully forking? To answer this question, let’s suppose she have q
proportion of the total mining power.</p>
<p>Let’s have k, the number of confirmations after which she’ll give up,
be equal to 1. This means she has a q times q, or q^2 chance of
successfully orphaning my block.</p>
<p>In a case where q is equal to 20%, this means her chance of
successfully orphaning my block is just 20% squared, or 4%. These are
not great odds.</p>
<p>Even though her odds of actually orphaning my block are very low,
they still change the rest of the miners’ choice model in a powerful
way. If the miners’ block is rejected, the miners will make 0 profit.
However, if the miners’ block is accepted, then the profit the miners
will expect to receive will vary based on whether they include my
transaction in the block.</p>
<p>If they do choose to include my transaction, then the miners’
expected payoff from doing so will be my transaction fee plus the block
reward times the probability that the attacking mining pool does not
orphan the block with my transaction, or 1-q squared. However, if they
choose not to include my transaction, then their expected payoff will
just be the block reward. In order for the expected payoff from
including my transaction to be greater than the expected payoff from not
including my transaction, I must pay a transaction fee that offsets the
difference. This can prove incredibly expensive and perhaps infeasible
for me.</p>
<p>Thus, we have shown that even with 20 percent of the network
hashrate, we can make it prohibitively expensive for someone to
participate in the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Now that we have the game theory knowledge, you have likely seen the
same attack from a completely different perspective. This is exactly
what we’re aiming for, to understand common blockchain protocols from
this cryptoeconomics perspective. We’ll leverage this frame of mind as
we dive into the next section, Proof-of-Stake.</p>

this cryptoeconomics perspective. We’ll leverage this frame of mind as
we dive into the next section, Proof-of-Stake.</p>

<h3>Intro: Proof-of-Stake</h3>

<p>Now you understand how economics is used to incentivize good
decisions and how cryptography is used to secure those decisions.</p>
<p>The combination of these two frames of mind will give you a holistic
view of cryptoeconomics, the approach for analyzing decentralized
networks with incentive schemes.</p>
<p>We mentioned Proof-of-Stake in the previous lecture in terms of how
it works and its’ general mechanics.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll go more in depth at it through the lens of
cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake is a particular type of blockchain system that assumes
all voting power is attached to financial resources.</p>
<p>Through cryptoeconomics, we want to understand how actors in a
Proof-of-Stake system can be incentivized to do the right thing and
disincentivized to cheat.</p>
<p>Through the cryptographic and economic primitives, we learned in the
previous sections, we’ll break down Proof-of-Stake choices at an
architectural level.</p>

<h3>Proof-of-Stake</h3>

<p>Up until now, the main consensus algorithm we’ve focused on is
Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work, although the system behind the most popular
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, still has many drawbacks.</p>
<p>For example, we have already mentioned the massive amount of energy
consumption required for Proof-of-Work, the potential for 51% attacks,
as well as the shift from decentralized individual miners, to more
centralized mining pools.</p>
<p>To solve some of these issues, Proof-of-Stake was introduced.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism where
voting power is directly proportional to economic stake locked up in the
network, instead of computational power and resources.</p>
<p>Each participant stakes a certain amount of native currency, and each
node is given a probability of being chosen as the next validator,
weighted by how much was at stake.</p>
<p>Once a validator is chosen, they can propose a valid block and
receive a reward.</p>
<p>With this scheme, how much power a participant has in the network is
limited by the amount they are willing to stake.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on rewards for security, Proof-of-Stake relies on
penalties.</p>
<p>If a participant places stake on a dishonest block, they are
penalized and lose however much they put at stake.</p>
<p>In this, acting maliciously is penalized much more heavily than the
gain from acting honestly.</p>
<p>This is one example of defender’s advantage.</p>
<p>Nodes are now more disincentivized to act maliciously due to the
explicit consequences of doing so.</p>
<p>This security comes from locking up capital for long periods of
time.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work, on the other hand, has no such defender’s advantage:
the cost of attacking and the cost of defending are 1:1, meaning the
amount of resources I spend on acting honestly versus acting dishonestly
are equal.</p>
<p>There is no explicit disincentive against acting maliciously in
Proof-of-Work: it just simply allows it.</p>
<p>Another advantage Proof-of-Stake has over Proof-of-Work is the
drawback in attempting a 51% attack.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, a dishonest actor needs 51% of the network’s hash
power, and if achieved, can censor transactions, rewrite transaction
history, and perform double spend attacks.</p>
<p>Nodes are not explicitly discouraged from attempting a 51% attack,
and, if unsuccessful, only lose the resources used to attempt the
attack.</p>
<p>This cannot be said for Proof-of-Stake, which requires 51% of the
network’s coins.</p>
<p>This is incredibly expensive, and then the attacker must stake all of
their wealth in order to attempt executing the attack.</p>
<p>Since this miner owns 51% of the cryptocurrency, it is not in their
best interest to attack a network that they hold a majority share in if
the value of the currency were to drop due to the attack.</p>
<p>As seen, there are major drawbacks in attempting this, another
example of Proof-of-Stake’s disincentive focused system.</p>
<p>Although Proof-of-Stake fixes many issues with Proof-of-Work, it is
not without its own drawbacks.</p>
<p>For example, there is the problem of the “rich get richer.”</p>
<p>Those with more wealth can stake more and increase their chances of
creating the next block, and therefore receiving the reward, and
increasing their wealth further.</p>
<p>One implementation of Proof-of-Stake is Ethereum’s Casper Protocol,
which takes this to another step, which enforces a minimum stake value
required to validate blocks.</p>
<p>Some argue that this takes the issue to an extreme and makes the
system even much more centralized.</p>
<p>However, only time will tell.</p>
<p>Another issue of Proof-of-Stake stems from the fact that amount of
voting power is tied directly to how much stake one has.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, anyone can buy ASICs and begin participating in the
network, but in Proof-of-Stake, all the voting power is internal to the
system so one can only obtain stake if a current stakeholder sells
theirs.</p>
<p>This means that if a single actor is able to obtain 51% of the
cryptocurrency, there is no way for this power to be taken back by the
rest of the network.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, dislodging 51% power would only require more
computation through more honest mining, reducing the relative power of
the malicious actor.</p>
<p>However, in Proof-of-Stake, the only way to reduce this power is to
decrease relative amount of cryptocurrency the dishonest validator
has.</p>
<p>However, there is no way to do this without the 51% stakeholder
willingly selling their stake.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake also introduces the liquidity problem.</p>
<p>Since validators must lock up their funds in order to have a stake in
the network, the actual amount of funds available for transactions is
much lower.</p>
<p>This reduces the liquidity of the cryptocurrency itself, decreases
the amount of available funds, and increases price and demand.</p>
<p>But because of this, validators are more incentivized to hold onto
their funds and sell it when the prices increase, rather than
participate in the network.</p>
<p>One more issue is the fact that someone can rewrite the history of
blockchain if someone with a huge share of stake sells their private
keys.</p>
<p>By obtaining such a large stake in the network, they change previous
transactions on a different chain.</p>
<p>Outside of these drawbacks of Proof-of-Stake that were mentioned,
there are also specific attacks that can be conducted in a
Proof-of-Stake system that will be covered in the next section.</p>

<h3>Intro: Attacks</h3>

<p>In this last section, we’ll cover Proof-of-Stake attacks, again
analyzing them from the perspective of cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>Each attack represents a scenario in which the incentives of an
individual are not aligned with the incentives of a group.</p>
<p>In other words, these game theoretical attacks allow individuals to
gain an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Work, some penalties are implicit – wasting mining power
on a malicious fork will cost you computational power if the attack
doesn’t succeed.</p>
<p>In Proof-of-Stake, however, because all the information is virtual,
every penalty needs to be explicitly defined.</p>
<p>Because the resource consumed is monetary value, bad actors need to
receive an explicit monetary penalty with each attempted attack to keep
the system in check.</p>

  alt="Nothing at Stake: Undesirable Path." />

<p>Let’s start looking at the most basic problem in Proof-of-Stake: the
Nothing at Stake attack.</p>
<p>This problem stems from the fact that all voting uses virtual
resources, rather than physical ones like Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the goal of the blockchain: to come to consensus on a
single correct chain.</p>
<p>Anything that prevents this from happening should be discouraged.</p>

<p>If ever the blockchain ends up in a situation which consensus is not
desirable for individual actors, then there is an issue.</p>
<p>These two forks might continue on forever, and no one will come to
consensus!</p>
<p>What is it about Proof-of-Stake that makes this an issue?</p>

  alt="Nothing at Stake: Attack."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Take a look at the bottom image demonstrating Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>As you know, Proof-of-Work implies that each actor has a limited
amount of computational power that can be expended at any point in
time.</p>
<p>If a miner sees a fork, they will be forced to decide how to split up
their voting power.</p>
<p>If each fork has an expected chance of becoming the longest chain,
then the best strategy is to maximize the overall expected value of your
efforts.</p>
<p>Fork A has a 90% chance of succeeding, so the expected value from
mining on that fork is 0.9.</p>
<p>Fork B similarly, with a 10% chance of success, has a 0.1 expected
return value.</p>
<p>If the miner were to split their vote between forks, they’d end up
with a 0.5 expected return.</p>
<p>The best choice is obviously to mine exclusively on Fork A for the
highest expected value of return.</p>
<p>But what happens in Proof-of-Stake under these same
circumstances?</p>
<p>Fork A again has a 90% chance of success, and Fork B a 10%
chance.</p>
<p>Voting exclusively on Fork A has a 0.9 expected return, and
exclusively on Fork B a 0.1 expected return.</p>
<p>But what about voting on both?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there’s no physical restriction stopping someone
from putting their signature on the next block of each fork.</p>
<p>In fact, by voting on each block, the voter is able to maximize their
expected return value.</p>
<p>One of the forks must beat the other; this is a guarantee.</p>
<p>If getting your votes into the longest fork is what gives you the
most reward, why not vote in all forks so that you win no matter which
fork is best?</p>
<p>This leads to the expected value of voting on both forks as 1, making
it the clear choice for any rational actor.</p>
<p>This is troublesome because the implication is that there will never
be a longest fork!</p>
<p>Both forks will continue to grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve this?</p>

<p>Well, to discourage voting on voting on incorrect forks, let’s
introduce a penalty to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Though the solution is simple on the surface, it has great
implications.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of penalties to choose from.</p>
<p>One of them is to punish anyone who votes on the wrong fork.</p>
<p>The other is to punish anyone who votes on multiple forks.</p>
<p>Both of these punishments are known as “slashing.”</p>
<p>Because someone might vote on what seems like the right fork in their
local view as honestly as possible but is actually the wrong fork to the
rest of the network, most Proof-of-Stake design choices choose the
second version of the penalty.</p>
<p>But how can we enforce this penalty?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each validator voting on a block provides a
signature, demonstrating a conscious choice to put their stake behind a
block.</p>
<p>If we find conflicting signatures, meaning two blocks in different
forks with signatures from the same validator, we can broadcast this
information to the rest of the network as proof of their malicious
activity.</p>
<p>Because all voting is virtual, even the penalties for malicious
voting strategies need to be explicitly enforced.</p>

  alt="Nothing at Stake: Defense #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As you can see in this example, we’ve made it such that the best
choice is to vote on fork A. This is because voting on fork B, or voting
on both, now leads to penalties for the voter.</p>

  title="Long Range Attack: Attack"
  alt="Long Range Attack: Attack."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One major attack that can be conducted in a Proof-of-Stake network is
a long-range attack.</p>
<p>In this scenario, attackers essentially create a new chain of
transactions starting from the Genesis block and then attempt to take
over the main chain.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54g. long range attack: attack #2 (115) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054g.png?raw=true"
  title="Long Range Attack: Attack #2"
  alt="Long Range Attack: Attack #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>There are two properties in Proof-of-Stake that allow this to happen:
nothing-at-stake and weak subjectivity.</p>
<p>Nothing-at-stake, which is explained earlier, allows for long range
attacks due to the costless nature of creating a branch.</p>
<p>Next, there is weak subjectivity.</p>
<p>When a new node joins a Proof-of-Stake network, the only block that
is accepted is the genesis block.</p>
<p>These nodes are also given all of the published chains, which makes
it difficult for nodes to choose the main blockchain.</p>
<p>Weak subjectivity is a problem for both new nodes and nodes that come
back online after being offline for long periods of time: neither of
these nodes know which of the chains they are given is the main
chain.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54h. long range attack: attack #3 (116) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054h.png?raw=true"
  title="Long Range Attack: Attack #3"
  alt="Long Range Attack: Attack #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One preconception about blockchains in general is that the longest
chain is the most trustworthy one.</p>
<p>This can be said about proof-of-work, as the longest chain has the
most computational work done on it.</p>
<p>However, unlike in Proof-of-Work, in which the main chain can be
quite easily determined by finding this longest chain, Proof-of-Stake
has no easy way to determine this.</p>
<p>This means that a chain that was created with the goal of executing a
long range attack can potentially be accepted as the main chain.</p>
<p>To explain this clearly, we will step through an example.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54i. long range attack: example (117) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054i.png?raw=true"

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Suppose Gloria owns 1% of the tokens the moment the genesis block is
created.</p>
<p>Instead of “mining” on the main chain, she mines on her own secret
chain.</p>
<p>Because it basically costs nothing to create blocks, Gloria can
easily create a chain that is longer than the current main chain.</p>
<p>If this chain is accepted and replaces the other chain, Gloria has
effectively rewritten the entire blockchain history starting from a
specific block.</p>
<p>This is called a long range attack because it can be executed from
any point of the chain, including the genesis block.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054j.png?raw=true"
  title="Stake Grinding: Attack"
  alt="Stake Grinding: Attack."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Next, we’ll take a look at the Stake Grinding attack.</p>
<p>This attack takes advantage of the fact that in a Proof-of-Stake
protocol, we need a method of randomly picking the next validator.</p>
<p>In case that validator is offline, we need a next validator we can
call upon, and so on.</p>
<p>In other words, we must create a protocol to develop an infinite
random sequence of validators we can call upon in case the next one is
offline.</p>
<p>In practice however, a validator will be found within the first few
validators we call upon.</p>
<p>In some proof-of-stake implementations, the validator chosen depends
on the previous block’s signature.</p>
<p>This setup opens up the opportunity for attackers to choose block
signatures in the blocks they produce to increase their probability of
getting chosen as a block validator.</p>
<p>Attackers can choose from different block signatures by playing
around with the block parameters to change the signature outcome.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image054k.png?raw=true"
  title="Stake Grinding: Defense"
  alt="Stake Grinding: Defense."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>There are a few ways that we can address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The first is that we can stop using any mutable parameters from the
previous block to generate the random pick for the next validator.</p>
<p>In other words, only parameters that miners have no control over
should be used to generate randomness.</p>
<p>We can also have all validators deposit their stake well in advance,
so that individuals cannot plan on being a validator in the next
round.</p>
<p>Finally, we can have some secret sharing mechanism where we have
multiple validators come to consensus on some random value that can help
pick the validator for the next round.</p>
<p>Unless there is collusion within the majority, this strategy should
work.</p>

<h3>Text: Week 2 Summary</h3>

<p>Written by Deven Navani and Nicholas Shen</p>

<h3>I. Cryptoeconomics</h3>

<p>Economic principles help us to design a system so that actors are
incentivized to make decisions in line with the goals of the greater
good. We are able to <strong>secure the future</strong>. (e.g. block
reward in Bitcoin and cost of mining to deter Sybil attacks)</p>
<p>Cryptography allows us to <strong>secure the past</strong> and ensure
our decisions cannot be manipulated by observers (e.g. cryptographic
signatures for authentication and hashes for immutability)</p>

<ol start="2" type="I">
  <h3><li>Cryptography</li></h3>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cryptography</strong> aims to secure the integrity and
confidentiality of information.</p>
<p>The need for cryptography is especially important in distributed
systems, where unknown actors are a potential threat to the secrecy and
safekeeping of information.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of transforming
information into an unintelligible intermediary piece of information
which can be transformed back into its original state
with <strong>decryption</strong>. An early example of encryption was the
Roman Empire’s use of the <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong>, in which
messages are encrypted by shifting letters to the right by a previously
set amount.</p>

  alt="Caesar Cipher."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Be aware of various cryptographic primitives (review from previous course):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cryptographic hash functions</strong>, used to capture the identity 
    of information without revealing anything about the information itself</li>
  <li><strong>Digital signatures</strong>, used to prove your identity and that 
    you sent a particular message</li>
  <li><strong>Erasure codes</strong> lower the 100% data availability requirement</li>
  <li><strong>Timelocks</strong> allow for a message to be easily encrypted but take 
    a longer amount of time to decrypt.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3" type="I">
  <li><h3>Economics</h3></li>
</ol>

<p>Economics boils down to a fundamental question: how do you determine
the best choice to make with your limited resources in order to maximize
your profit? Economics also helps us to design a system so that everyone
is incentivized to act in a certain way.</p>
<p>In <strong>game theory</strong>, we aim to deduce how an actor will
act in a given situation. These decisions are influenced by the actions
of others and the rewards and penalties associated with certain
decisions. Therefore we aim to manipulate these factors.</p>
<p>In blockchain, <strong>tokens</strong> are used as economic
incentives. Tokens are units of protocol defined cryptocurrency given
out to miners and privileges miners can charge for. The assumption here
is that the underlying objective for actors in a blockchain network is
to maximize their profit, which equals their revenues minus their
costs.</p>

<ol start="4" type="I">
  <h3><li>Proof of Stake</li></h3>
</ol>

<p>Proof-of-Stake is a particular type of consensus mechanism that
assumes all voting power is tied to financial resources. Fundamentally,
the idea is: the more tokens or currency an actor holds within a
Proof-of-Stake system, the stronger the incentive for them to be good
stewards of said system; if the system grows the wealthier the actor
becomes. Thus in Proof-of-Stake, we give these individuals the most
power as validators.</p>
<p>Major PoS implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tendermint</strong> - First BFT-based PoS consensus mechanism, 
    published in 2014</li>
  <li><strong>Casper the Friendly GHOST (CBC)</strong> - a family of consensus 
    algorithms designed from ground up i.e. Correct-by-construction, a proposed 
	upgrade for the Ethereum network</li>
  <li><strong>Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget</strong> - a Proof-of-Work 
    and Proof-of-Stake hybrid; another upgrade proposed for the Ethereum network</li>
</ul>

<h3>V. Attacks</h3>

<p>Each proof of stake attack represents a scenario in which the
incentives of an individual are not aligned with the incentives of a
group, i.e. giving an unfair advantage to any single actor. Because the
resource consumed is monetary value, bad actors need to receive an
explicit monetary penalty with each attempted attack to keep the system
in check. </p>
<p>If there was zero penalty, the expected profit of any given attack
would be some number greater than zero, providing an incentive. By
penalizing users for incorrect or malicious actions, the system hopes to
bring the expected value to less than or equal to zero.</p>
<p>Examples of attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nothing-at-Stake</strong>: voting in favor of every fork
in hopes of maximizing one’s rewards i.e. guaranteeing you will not miss
the reward from the chosen branch; solution: slashing an actor if they
are caught voting on multiple forks, or a less popular scheme penalizes
incorrect votes; keep in mind that voting takes place using
cryptographically identifiable/verifiable signatures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stake grinding</strong>: attack where a validator
performs some computation or takes some other step to try to bias the
randomness in their own favor; solution: require validators to deposit
their coins well in advance, and avoid information that can be easily
manipulated as source data for randomness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weak subjectivity</strong> is a problem for new nodes or
nodes that have been offline for a long time; the node does not know
which chain is the main chain; solution: introduce a “revert limit” - a
rule that nodes must simply refuse to revert further back in time than
the deposit length.</p>

<h1 id="ch3">Real-World Applications: Enterprise Blockchain - Week 3</h1>

<p>Welcome to Week 3 of CS198.2x, Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve primarily been studying blockchains designed for public
use.</p>
<p>While these systems are interesting to build and study, many business
use cases don’t require the same level of decentralization and
trustlessness.</p>
<p>This is because public blockchains tend to assume nothing about the
motivations or incentives of users in the network, hence preparing
themselves for the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>This ensures maximum trustlessness, but the guarantee reduces
efficiency greatly.</p>
<p>Many enterprise use cases, on the other hand, require a lower level
of trustlessness and decentralization in the system.</p>
<p>Blockchain systems are not strictly decentralized, but instead on a
spectrum – we’ll be taking a look at the different kinds of systems we
can design.</p>
<p>We’ll first take a look at where enterprise blockchain systems fit in
the whole space, as well as the current platforms and other
infrastructure available for use.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll look at some specific use cases and industries and how
blockchain fits in (or doesn’t).</p>
<p>And finally, we’ll take a step back and look at the culture,
regulations, and caveats surrounding enterprise blockchains.</p>

<h3>Intro: Enterprise Blockchain Overview</h3>

<p>Before jumping straight into enterprise blockchain platforms and use
cases, as always, we must first understand the architectural decisions
that enterprise use cases need to make.</p>
<p>What problems are we trying to solve?</p>
<p>What exactly is an enterprise blockchain?</p>
<p>Does it make sense to have one for this particular issue, or will
traditional methods work better?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give all the context we need in order to start
thinking about enterprise blockchains.</p>
<p>First, we’ll tell the story of how we started from open-access,
trustless, and decentralized blockchains, to developing more trusted and
centralized enterprise blockchains.</p>
<p>We’ll then make a quick comparison between related technologies and
distinguish different types of blockchains available for use.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Blockchain History (3:56)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 56. banks and blockchain: history review (125) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image056.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Banks and Blockchain: Blockchain History Review"
  alt="Banks and Blockchain: Blockchain History Review." />

<p>As Bitcoin and blockchain grew increasingly popular, banks and large
corporations began to take notice of the potential applications of this
new technology.</p>
<p>However, while cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin wanted to eliminate
the need for banks by creating a public distributed ledger, banks wanted
to harness the same blockchain technology without making their own
institutions redundant.</p>
<p>Instead, banks wanted to use blockchain technology to create
“permissioned blockchains”, or private networks in which some central
authority controls who is able to take part in consensus and validate
transactions on the network.</p>
<p>This interest eventually led to the rise of enterprise
blockchains.</p>
<p>Such permissioned blockchains were not open and not trustless, and
lacked the economic incentives we’ve studied in the past.</p>
<p>But this is all ok, since the goal here wasn’t to create another
public blockchain network like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Instead, it was to separate the “blockchain” from “Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>The general movement was that of curiosity and competition – to see
how blockchain technology could apply to businesses, and improve their
competitive edge.</p>
<p>The sentiment around this was mixed though.</p>
<p>Many saw this as just glorified public key cryptography – and at its
core, just a new buzzword to boost hype and traffic and stock
prices.</p>
<p>At the same time, others encouraged the research into fundamental
blockchain technologies, as they were more compliant and better suited
for enterprise use than associated public blockchain systems.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>While many use cases exist for enterprise blockchains, most problems
that enterprise blockchain aims to solve fall within three broad
classifications: solving coordination failures, horizontally integrating
systems, and creating self-sovereign decentralized networks.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"

  title="Scaling Issues: Blockchain History Review"
  alt="Scaling Issues: Blockchain History Review."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Although many enterprises now wish to take advantage of blockchain
technology, true enterprise blockchain solutions are typically very
situational.</p>
<p>In their current state, blockchains do the equivalent of making a
computer hundreds or thousands of times less efficient, since each node
in the network must redundantly make the same computations as all other
nodes in the network.</p>
<p>In order to come to consensus, these nodes must then communicate with
other nodes all around the world, which further introduces latency
issues.</p>
<p>As a result, blockchains are far less scalable than traditional
systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, blockchains introduce security risks, as hacks are no
longer restrained to compromising data but can allow perpetrators to
steal money directly.</p>
<p>All these factors combined mean that enterprise blockchain use cases
must have specific scaling and use case requirements that would make a
non-blockchain solution unfeasible.</p>
<p>And as previously mentioned, industry has shown that enterprise
blockchains are most optimally used to solve coordination failures,
horizontally integrate systems, and create self-sovereign distributed
and decentralized networks.</p>
<p>Let’s look back at the previous slide.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Banks and Blockchain: Blockchain History Review." />

<p>Coordination failures between multiple parties seeking to work
together often exist due to trust issues.</p>
<p>Blockchain solves this issue by creating arbitrary incentive
structures and being able to operate in the public domain without the
coordination of a centralized entity, making it ideal for enterprise
projects such as public infrastructure.</p>
<p>Blockchain is also an integration technology – it combines data silos
together into a single integrated system that captures greater economies
of scale.</p>
<p>By ensuring data immutability, integrity, auditability, and
authenticity, blockchains enforce a common API and data standard,
allowing multiple systems to be immediately interoperable.</p>
<p>Lastly, blockchain provides new decentralized models to work with
alongside existing centralized ones, thus preventing the possibility of
centralized corruption.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Blockchain Overview</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 57. blockchain vs databases: high-level overview (129) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image057.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Blockchain vs. Databases: High-Level Overview"
  alt="Blockchain vs. Databases: High-Level Overview." />

<p>At its most basic level, a blockchain is merely a highly specialized
type of database.</p>
<p>Here on the right, you can see a very generalized and broad
categorization of databases.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we can have either centralized or distributed
databases.</p>
<p>Of course, with a centralized database, you have to trust the single
database – there’s no consensus to be reached.</p>
<p>With distributed databases, that’s where the idea of trust starts to
be more of a concern.</p>
<p>In distributed databases, you could have a network of trusted,
fault-tolerant databases.</p>
<p>However, within distributed databases, we can also have distributed
ledgers, which generally imply looser trust guarantees.</p>
<p>They enable parties who don’t fully trust each other to come to
consensus.</p>
<p>And then finally, blockchains are a subclass of distributed
ledgers.</p>
<p>We’ll go into detail in a bit.</p>
<p>One note is that while there might be contention in what the
definition of “distributed” and decentralized and centralized actually
means in the context of database classification, especially within the
blockchain space, in this course we generally mean in terms of politics
and geography.</p>
<p>For example, we might refer to an organization’s database systems as
centralized, because they are all operated by a single entity – so
they’re politically centralized.</p>
<p>And in terms of geography and spatiality, we could have a single
“central” database or multiple databases either geographically
centralized or decentralized.</p>
<p>To better understand this, let’s go back to the form of databases
most people are familiar with: centralized databases.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 76b. centralized database: blockchain vs databases (130) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image076b.png?raw=true"
  title="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases"
  alt="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Centralized databases, such as a single password server, are located,
stored, and maintained in one location, with one central entity handling
all requests and data processing.</p>
<p>Some advantages of this are: design simplicity, immediate data
updates, cost effectiveness, and minimal redundancy.</p>
<p>However, centralized databases also have many inherent disadvantages:
they are prone to bottlenecks, lack simultaneous write access by
multiple users to the same set of data, and act as a single point of
failure.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 77b. centralized database: blockchain vs databases #2 (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image077b.png?raw=true"
  title="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #2"
  alt="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>On the other hand, distributed databases consist of groups of nodes
which trust each other and cooperate to maintain a consistent view of
the overall system.</p>
<p>Because there is no longer a single point of failure, the system is
more fault-tolerant and can handle more demand by distributing load
evenly across all nodes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 78b. centralized database: blockchain vs databases #3 (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image078b.png?raw=true"
  title="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #3"
  alt="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>However, distributed databases also introduce increased complexity,
cost, and redundancy as well as exposing more points of failure.</p>
<p>That’s just the overhead of being distributed.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 79b. centralized database: blockchain vs databases #4 (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #4"
  alt="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #4."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>A specific type of distributed database is a distributed ledger,
which contains nodes operated by different entities that may or may not
trust each other.</p>
<p>While many consensus mechanisms exist for distributed ledgers, those
that specifically implement a chain of blocks in their record-keeping
and consensus protocols are known as blockchains.</p>

  alt="Cenralized Database: Blockchain vs Databases #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Recall from our Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies course that the
fundamental innovation of blockchain was not to enable distributed
information sharing.</p>
<p>As we have just seen, many forms of distributed databases exist that
allow for distributed information sharing without a blockchain.</p>
<p>Instead, blockchain’s uniqueness lies in its distributed
record-keeping and decentralized exchange of value.</p>
<p>Compared to a traditional database, a blockchain system is uniquely
able to remove the need for a centralized administrator and allow for
non-trusting parties in the network to interact with each other.</p>

<p>Blockchains can also be categorized based on their architecture and
the trust and access permissions that a typical user possesses.</p>
<p>Most generally, all blockchains fall into either the public or
permissioned categories.</p>
<p>Public blockchains are the most widespread and well-known type of
blockchains.</p>
<p>Some examples include the two most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin
and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world has read access to public blockchains, can
propose to make changes to their protocols, and can participate in their
consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>This makes public blockchains advantageous in providing
decentralization and censorship resistance.</p>
<p>The network effects associated with use of these public blockchain
platforms result in increased application development.</p>
<p>For example, there are thousands of DApps built on top of Ethereum,
and often less than 100 per private platform.</p>
<p>However, since public blockchains are open and accessible to everyone
by definition, they limit the type of information that can be directly
stored on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Sensitive and private data (i.e. medical records, SSNs, private keys)
should not be put on a blockchain in plain text.</p>
<p>Public blockchains inherently function in a trustless
environment.</p>
<p>Trust is no longer placed in people and organizations but rather in
the math and code behind the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Looking away from fully trustless public blockchains, we have what
are known as permissioned ledgers or permissioned blockchains.</p>
<p>Within the category of permissioned blockchains, there are both fully
private blockchains, where permissions are centralized to one entity,
and consortium – or federated – blockchains, where permissions are
controlled by a central group of entities.</p>
<p>In permissioned blockchains, write permissions are limited to one
central entity or consortium of entities, and read permissions may or
may not be limited as well.</p>
<p>Permissioned blockchains allow organizations to change the rules of
the blockchain at their discretion, allow for cheaper transactions,
provide greater privacy, and mitigate the risk of traditional consensus
based attacks.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional public blockchains, permissioned blockchains don’t
have the property of being (publicly) open and trustless.</p>
<p>However, in an enterprise setting, permissioned blockchains might be
used to solve a coordination problem amongst the loosely linked
constituents.</p>

<p>While blockchain is still in its infancy, many tech powerhouses are
already starting to show interest.</p>
<p>For example, Microsoft recently released the Blockchain Workbench,
which is a set of tools on the Azure Platform for developers that work

<p>Hyperledger currently focuses on tackling problems in supply chain,
healthcare, and finance.</p>
<p>Companies such as Walmart and Nestle have used Hyperledger to track
food delivery in their supply chains.</p>
<p>Ethereum Enterprise Alliance is an organization within the Ethereum
community hoping to extend Ethereum’s influence on enterprise.</p>

<p>Despite enterprise movement towards blockchain, there’s still
differing perspectives and sentiment about blockchain technology as a
whole – and this all depends on the audience that you’re speaking to, of
course.</p>
<p>There are those who may be Bitcoin maximalists, who believe in the
original vision of Bitcoin and blockchain, and despise enterprise
blockchains for associating political centralization with the
decentralized initial vision of blockchain.</p>
<p>And there are also the people who say that enterprise blockchain
sucks.</p>
<p>Different people of different backgrounds tend to have this shared
opinion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin maximalists might not like the use of blockchain by the
companies that it was originally created to circumvent.</p>
<p>And these same individuals might really advocate for the use of
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, perhaps those more experience in the traditional industry
might also say that enterprise blockchain sucks, but for the reason that
they understand and prefer more traditional politically centralized
cloud solutions.</p>
<p>Industry may also have those who know to dissociate cryptocurrencies
and blockchain.</p>
<p>And some might even be too optimistic about blockchain being useful
in every enterprise use case.</p>
<p>Finally, there are those who are more educated and recognize the
strengths and weaknesses of the applicability of blockchain
technology.</p>
<p>Blockchain can be cool, but only in very particular ways.</p>

  title="Misconceptions: Not Always What You'd Expect"
  alt="Misconceptions: Not Always What You'd Expect."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>It’s a misconception that enterprise blockchains are always
useful.</p>
<p>Some use cases have fundamental flaws – usually a misalignment with
the core strengths and benefits of blockchain and distributed ledger
technologies.</p>
<p>These use cases don’t warrant using a blockchain, and could perhaps
could be addressed with centralized or distributed databases – but not a
blockchain.</p>
<p>It’s also a misconception that blockchains are more efficient than
some centralized solutions.</p>
<p>This misconception could be addressed from many different angles.</p>
<p>The question is: how we define efficiency?</p>
<p>If we’re talking about computational efficiency, then we already know
that blockchains are highly redundant and therefore not computationally
efficient.</p>
<p>After all, why write to potentially tens of thousands of nodes all
over the world when you could just write to a couple, if not just
one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficiency could be analyzed further, at which
point it’s a matter of contemplating the tradeoffs between
decentralization and scalability.</p>
<p>Similarly, there might also be people who say blockchains are
cheap.</p>
<p>Generally, blockchains are very costly to maintain and develop, since
it’s mainly a community effort.</p>
<p>And finally, another misconception might be that if an enterprise use
case has already decided on using blockchain, they might think that they
should just build their own blockchain, rather than using existing
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Building your own blockchain isn’t as simple as one might expect.</p>
<p>In the past, many projects did just end up forking the Bitcoin
blockchain’s codebase.</p>
<p>But nowadays, existing blockchain development frameworks have proven
to be successful and secure.</p>

<h3>Intro: Enterprise Blockchain Platforms</h3>

<p>Now that we have a clear working framework for categorizing and
designing blockchain system architectures, we can start to see some of
the patterns between these categories.</p>
<p>Naturally, the best decision for the community is to develop tools to
make these common necessities easily available and secure for anyone
else to build off of.</p>
<p>As with any emerging technological field, the importance of
infrastructure and accessibility for developers and companies looking to
flesh out out use cases is just as important as the technology
itself.</p>
<p>Reducing access barriers and uncertainty around a growing technology
is crucial to capturing widespread adoption.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss various enterprise blockchain platforms and which use
cases they’re geared towards – categorized primarily by their access
type and consensus mechanisms.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Blockchain Platforms</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 58. things to look for: enterprise blockchain platforms (141) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image058.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Things to Look For: Enterprise Blockchain Platforms"
  alt="Things to Look For: Enterprise Blockchain Platforms." />

<p>In the early days of blockchain development, the most common projects
forked the original Bitcoin codebase to modify small but significant
portions of the codebase.</p>
<p>Litecoin and Dogecoin using Scrypt, the memory-hard hash function, is
an example of this.</p>
<p>This process required modifying the Bitcoin source code directly as
well as developing a new community and a new set of miners–essentially
starting from scratch on all levels.</p>
<p>With the popularization of Ethereum, smart contracts enabled users,
from developers to companies to blockchain activists, to encode business
logic directly into an existing platform rather than making their own
from scratch.</p>
<p>However, this also means that each application is competing for
resources with all other applications on the same network.</p>
<p>And this was demonstrated by Cryptokitties throttling the Ethereum
Network.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to one website clogging the entire Internet.</p>
<p>While both these approaches were good starting points, they always
brought with them high overhead and low optimization.</p>
<p>What if we want to make a blockchain or distributed ledger network
with lower requirements for trustlessness to decrease overhead?</p>
<p>With the increased trust assumptions in permissioned ledgers, there’s
no longer a strong enough need for high computational expenditure to
reduce the chances of attack.</p>
<p>Enterprise blockchain platforms exist precisely to enable businesses
to implement their own blockchain use case ideas without starting from
scratch.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be taking a look at some enterprise blockchain
platforms.</p>
<p>We’ll take a look at what blockchain platforms are out there in the
industry today, that companies have started to develop on top of, rather
than building their own blockchains – leveraging modularity in
design.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that none of the examples within this lecture are
supporting or opposing any particular initiatives.</p>
<p>We’re simply sampling a variety of projects across multiple different
facets of the enterprise blockchain space.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image114.png?raw=true"
  title="Scalability: Trilemma"
  alt="Scalability: Trilemma."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As the use of blockchain becomes more and more prevalent, the issue
of scalability also grows.</p>
<p>The idea of the Scalability Trilemma is that from security,
decentralization, and scalability all blockchains can only have two out
of these three properties.</p>
<p>Initially, most blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
were built with the two main focuses on security and
decentralization.</p>
<p>However, as the number of users and transactions grew, the network
slowed down more, and bottlenecks with performance become apparent.</p>
<p>Due to this, many newer blockchains are taking scalability into
consideration into their designs, as well as previous ones attempting to
mitigate these issues by incorporating new ideas into existing
systems.</p>
<p>For example, Ethereum has researched into sharding and plasma for
potential solutions to its scaling problem.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin has its Lightning network.</p>
<p>Instead of attempting to solve scalability while keeping both
security and decentralization, some blockchains sacrifice the
decentralized property in order to allow for scalability.</p>
<p>In blockchains such as enterprise blockchains, they have less of a
need for decentralization, as their uses cases are usually limited to
very specific users.</p>
<p>Thus, these blockchains still follow the scalability trilemma and
exchange decentralization for scalability and security.</p>

<p>Ethereum is the industry standard blockchain platform for public
projects at this point.</p>
<p>Ethereum is, as stated on the website, a decentralized platform that
runs smart contracts, which are apps that run exactly as programmed - no
matter what.</p>
<p>These smart contracts are what made Ethereum so popular in the first
place - while Bitcoin remains the most apparent use of blockchain
technology, Ethereum generalized the advantages of blockchain.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s smart contracts are written in Solidity, which is a
Turing-complete language.</p>
<p>This basically means you can theoretically write any program using
it, and, therefore, you can theoretically run any program on the
Ethereum network.</p>
<p>This key innovation set the stage for many of the other platforms
that we’ll talk about later in this section.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was created precisely to meet the
needs of enterprise projects.</p>
<p>Consisting of several traditionally large names such as Intel, JP
Morgan, and Microsoft, along with blockchain organizations such as
Tendermint, Chronicled, and IC3.</p>
<p>Their aim is to produce blockchain standards for businesses of all
kinds to use.</p>
<p>ConsenSys is a startup founded by one of the Ethereum cofounders Joe
Lubin, meant to develop and foster growth in the Ethereum ecosystem,
helping popular initiatives such as MetaMask and Truffle.</p>

<p>Hyperledger, a project of the Linux Foundation, was one of the
earliest responses to the need for easily accessible permissioned or
private blockchain platforms.</p>
<p>And is led by Executive Director Brian Behlendorf.</p>
<p>Hyperledger focuses on a wide breadth of industries, including
finance, healthcare, and supply chain, some of the most popular use
cases.</p>
<p>Its goal is to allow any business or consortium to design their
custom blockchain from scratch with as little friction as possible.</p>
<p>Hyperledger is made of quite a few different projects.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric is the most popular to date, initiated by IBM,
written in the Go programming language.</p>
<p>It allows for smart contracts to be written on top of the platform,
along with confidential transactions to be made between select
participants.</p>
<p>It is also uses PFBT to come to consensus, specifically Kafka.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth is another version of Hyperledger, originally
coming from Intel, using Proof of Elapsed Time as the consensus
mechanism.</p>
<p>Using a Nakatomo Consensus style mechanism was to allow businesses to
develop permissionless blockchain networks, whereas Fabric can only
handle permissioned.</p>
<p>However, this leads to compromising on privacy.</p>
<p>Similar to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, many companies have
pledged their support towards Hyperledger, making for over 250
participants within the consortium.</p>

<p>Corda focuses on enabling banks to record, manage, synchronize, and
support financial transactions and agreements through distributed ledger
technology.</p>
<p>Though the technology does not use blockchains, the superset
“distributed ledger technology” refers to decentralized record
management.</p>
<p>This was a project first led by R3, a banking consortium which
attempted to unify major banking institutions around the world.</p>
<p>This system, like Hyperledger Fabric, has no native currency.</p>
<p>Additionally, their system requires the participation of notaries to
come to consensus, serving as authority services signing off on
previously seen transactions to provide uniqueness consensus.</p>
<p>Corda also has validity consensus guarantees.</p>
<p>Upon being asked to notarise a transaction, a notary will either: (1)
Sign the transaction if it has not already signed other transactions
consuming any of the proposed transaction input states, or (2) Reject
the transaction and flag that a end attempt has occurred otherwise.</p>

<p>Chain is another blockchain platform also aimed at financial services.</p>
<p>It uses a federated consensus mechanism with M-of-N signatures required in 
each quorum for the block to be considered valid for the individual nodes within 
the quorum.</p>
<p>Chain recognizes that is not currently currently byzantine fault tolerant, 
referencing PFBT and Tendermint as “showing promise in this area,” looking to 
potentially move in that direction in the future.</p>
<p>Chain also produced a cloud-based ledger service known as Sequence to provide 
Ledger-as-a-Service products to businesses, handling the infrastructure on behalf 
of businesses.</p>
<p>Private keys are kept in the hands of the entities using the network, while 
Sequence hosts the blockchain on behalf of the users, meaning that Sequence 
cannot produce transactions on any other users’ behalf.</p>

<p>Ripple is another enterprise blockchain platform focusing on creating
a global network of financial services.</p>
<p>To enable such payments, it uses an internal cryptocurrency called
XRP.</p>
<p>It runs a federated consensus mechanism, which we mentioned briefly
in week 1.</p>
<p>Within the network, there are various types of participants, which
Ripple classifies as: network users and network members.</p>
<p>Network members include banks and payment providers, and provide the
core services of the Ripple network such as processing payments and
providing liquidity.</p>
<p>The Ripple network enables them to have a wider reach – to expand
payout reach and increase payment volumes.</p>
<p>Network users on the other hand include corporates, small
medium-sized enterprises, small banks, and payment providers.</p>
<p>Network users use the services enabled by the Ripple network.</p>
<p>For example, platform businesses might look to send disbursements of
high volume and low value to suppliers, merchants, and employees.</p>
<p>Banks and payment providers might look to send payments – rather than
process them – and to overcome traditional inefficiencies of
correspondent banking.</p>
<p>Ripple network supports processing of real time payments, sourcing of
on demand liquidity, and sending global payments.</p>
<p>These are called xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia, respectively.</p>

<p>It has a two-way peg, which will be explained deeper in the next
lecture.</p>
<p>Essentially, a two-way peg is a method by which data can be
transferred between a main chain and a side chain.</p>
<p>Rootstock developed out of QixCoin, the first cryptocurrency
blockchain with a Turing-complete language, meant to enable peer to peer
games.</p>
<p>The QixCoin staff saw Bitcoin as a way to add security to their
platform through merge mining, which reuses the mining power of a main
chain on a side chain.</p>
<p>Rootstock aims not only to allow users to write smart contracts
interacting with the Bitcoin network but also to increase scalability,
using blockchain sharding techniques and creating blocks every ten
seconds instead of every ten minutes.</p>

<p>Quorum is a lightweight fork of Ethereum, built for enterprise, with
a particular focus on governance, confidentiality, and security for
streamlining global payments.</p>
<p>With Quorum, nodes and activity on the network can be tied to
real-world identities.</p>
<p>It also enables confidentiality, allowing for details of transactions
to be private.</p>
<p>Quorum can also be configured to have minimal trust assumptions
between participants.</p>
<p>Quorum manages much of its secure message transfers through a system
called Constellation.</p>
<p>This allows Quorum to have support for both public and private
transactions.</p>
<p>Public transactions are conducted as they would be on the Ethereum
network, whereas private transactions can only be viewed by participants
who have been specified as recipients.</p>
<p>Quorum enables configurable consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>QuorumChain is a simple majority voting protocol, where a certain set
of nodes are delegated voting rights.</p>
<p>And all nodes with voting rights themselves can also grant voting
rights to others.</p>
<p>Quorum also supports pluggable Istanbul BFT and Raft-based consensus
mechanisms.</p>

<p>Cosmos is an initiative to connect blockchains together.</p>
<p>Its focus on blockchain interoperability.</p>
<p>For example, if I currently want to exchange Bitcoin for Ether, I’d
have to go through an intermediary, like an exchange.</p>
<p>Cosmos, however, will allow us to connect multiple blockchains to the
same “hub,” powered by the consensus mechanism called Tendermint.</p>
<p>Tendermint also provides users with a way to build their own
blockchain apps in any language they’d like, through what’s known as the
“application blockchain interface.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, blockchains talk to each other through the “Inter
Blockchain Communication” protocol.</p>
<p>Cosmos and Tendermint can also be used in enterprise contexts.</p>
<p>Cosmos may provide a way for private blockchains to connect, even if
using different types of protocols, such as a Hyperledger Fabric
blockchain and a Corda blockchain.</p>
<p>Tendermint, being an efficient consensus mechanism, which starts with
a semi-trusted set of validators, is a prime consensus mechanism for
enterprise blockchain networks as well.</p>
<p>We’ll be focusing more on the specifics of Cosmos and Tendermint come

  style="width:45%" />

<p>As a short summary of all the enterprise blockchain platforms we’ve
seen in the past couple slides, let’s tie it back to a more fundamental
understanding of blockchain and enterprise use cases in general.</p>
<p>We want to focus on the underlying technology supporting these
enterprise blockchain platforms, so it’s always a good idea to look at
architecture.</p>
<p>Particularly, does the platform architecture work well with the use
cases that the developers want to enable?</p>
<p>For example, there’s an obvious difference between the focus of some
enterprise blockchains versus that of public blockchains.</p>
<p>We can sum this up nicely by referring back to the three key
properties we mentioned earlier: scalability, decentralization, and
security.</p>
<p>Enterprise blockchains often times have an inherent boost in their
ability to scale, since they work with smaller networks with trust
guarantees.</p>
<p>For the same reason, enterprise blockchains are less decentralized
than public blockchains – and this matches their use case.</p>
<p>Because enterprise blockchains are mostly permissioned, there are
also less potential security issues too.</p>
<p>Designing with these three properties – scalability,
decentralization, and security – in mind entails further consideration
of network architecture and choice of consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll see the applications of these, as well as
generalizations of enterprise blockchain use cases – and also when not
to use blockchain.</p>

<h3>Intro: Use Cases &amp; Industries</h3>

<p>This section will focus on various industries around the world to
give you a sense of what is currently being pursued to see into the
minds of big corporations as well as get a sense of the patterns behind
today’s blockchain ventures.</p>
<p>This is by no means a comprehensive list of blockchain use cases nor
advocating for any particular industry or company, but instead a small
insight into some of the common use cases seen within the enterprise
blockchain space.</p>
<p>Some use cases may be more appropriate for blockchain than others –
the goal is for you to apply your previous knowledge of blockchain’s
history and mechanisms to these use cases to evaluate for yourself the
use case quality.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Auto &amp; Mobility</h3>

  title="MOBI: Auto and Mobility"
  alt="MOBI: Auto and Mobility." />

<p>Mobility use cases combine blockchain, autonomous cars, and IoT.</p>
<p>There’s a nonprofit consortium known as MOBI (Mobility Open
Blockchain Initiative) aiming to make mobility services efficient,
green, affordable, safe, and free of congestion.</p>
<p>Fun fact, MOBI was co-founded by a Blockchain at Berkeley alumnus,
Ashley Lannquist, doing a lot of exploration of the industry.</p>

  alt="Vehicle Data Sharing & Exchange: Auto &amp; Mobility."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One of their major use cases revolves around collecting a car’s data,
the obvious stuff like miles driven, MPG, but also more micro datapoints
like the force applied to the accelerator, for the purpose of informing
safe driving cars.</p>
<p>Drivers will be automatically compensated for their data using token
micropayments.</p>
<p>This concept is also being explored by Toyota and Jaguar/Land
Rover.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image061.png?raw=true"
  title="Additional Use Cases: Auto & Mobility"
  alt="Additional Use Cases: Auto & Mobility."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As far as other use cases, there’s supply chain and provenance, so
tracking car parts, or an immutable ‘Carfax’-style used car
database.</p>
<p>That’s being done by a company known as CarVertical.</p>
<p>There’s also automatic machine-machine payments, for electric
vehicles and incentivizing autonomous vehicle decision making, like to
decide when a car gets to merge.</p>
<p>And then there’s car sharing, like a decentralized Uber or Lyft, or a
further decentralized Turo, which is basically Airbnb for cars.</p>
<p>Some 25% of payments to either of these services go straight to the
companies, not the people actually providing the cars.</p>
<p>Next, we’re going to look at blockchain applications within the
finance industry.</p>
<p>You’ll find that these use cases revolve primarily around
tokenization, disintermediated value transfer, privacy, and
traceability.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Finance</h3>

<p>The finance industry is particularly well-situated for the blockchain
revolution since a lot of the assets banks deal with are not necessarily
physical in nature, like stocks, bonds, etc.</p>
<p>The Dharma protocol is planning to move forward with this idea and
release a token that represents part of a debt asset.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to that of securitization, which is where you
turn an illiquid asset into a tradeable one.</p>
<p>Many large banks are also just investing in cryptocurrencies, notably
Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Blockchains and their associated assets are also allowing assets to
pass across borders and jurisdictions largely unencumbered by regulation
and intermediation.</p>
<p>Many cryptocurrencies can be bought in one country and sold in
another for local currency, without ever having to pay a premium for
exchange.</p>
<p>This is particularly good news for large banks, whose large-scale
transfers might have otherwise cost them a fortune.</p>
<p>Interbank transfers represent one of the most high-profile and
effective use cases of blockchain, and big names are paying attention -
JP Morgan launched the Interbank Information Network, and Ripple has
launched the Global Payments steering group, garnering support from
groups such as MUFG, BAML and the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>SWIFT, the current go-to for global financial transfer, is also
heavily invested in the space - their test project launched on
Hyperledger Fabric and yielded positive results earlier this year.</p>

<p>Lastly, many finance giants are using blockchain to facilitate
traceability and/or privacy.</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using blockchain as a
verification mechanism for digital certificates, and Wells Fargo is
using it to track securitized mortgages.</p>
<p>JPM Chase has launched its own ethereum-esque enterprise blockchain
platform, Quorum, which is optimized for finance usecases - private
transactions, permissioned network access, and smart contracts.</p>
<p>Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PwC are also banding together with Taiwanese
banks to use blockchain to help audit financial reports.</p>
<p>The transparency and immutability afforded to blockchain-based
systems is particularly enticing for accounting use cases.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Travel &amp; Tourism</h3>

  alt="Services: Travel & Tourism." />

<p>Blockchain is also making waves in the travel industry, allowing
people to keep track of their luggage, get better rates on extra rooms,
participate in the sharing economy, and set up secure payment channels,
all without paying an intermediary to handle it for them.</p>
<p>Winding Tree is using blockchain to disintermediate the process of
filling excess vacancies on flights and in hotels and has already
partnered with Nordic Choice hotels, as well as Lufthansa, Swiss Air,
and Eurowings.</p>
<p>Beenest is doing the same thing with home shares - its like Airbnb,
but without giving them a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Trippki is creating a decentralized rewards ecosystem with travelers
and hotels, making rewards transferable while still allowing hotels the
flexibility to make specialized offers.</p>

  style="width:45%;"
  title="Identity: Travel & Tourism"
  alt="Identity: Travel & Tourism." />

<p>Definitely one of the largest problems facing the travel industry
today is identity management.</p>
<p>How can an airline be sure if the person getting on their flight is
the person whose name is on the ticket?</p>
<p>What happens if you lose your driver’s license or passport before
taking a flight?</p>
<p>It turns out that this problem is challenging alone, but here’s what
companies in the travel industry are doing to solve it on their end.</p>
<p>SITA, the IT company providing support to a lot of the airline
industry, has created the Digital Traveler Identity App, which uses
blockchain to link a traveler to their identity and allows airlines and
agencies to verify their identity easily, while keeping the privacy
controls in the hands of the user.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dubai’s Immigration and Visa Department has partnered
with a UK-based startup ObjectTech to develop a digital passport concept
combining biometrics and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>ObjectTech is expected to launch its pilot program at the Dubai
Airport in 2020.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll be talking about broader approaches to digital
identity.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Digital Identity</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 67. self-sovereignty: digital identity (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image067.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Self-Sovereignty: Digital Identity"
  alt="Self-Sovereignty: Digital Identity." />

<p>Companies focusing on decentralized digital identity are focusing
heavily on a concept known as self-sovereignty of identity, which is the
ability to limit the information you share in situations today where you
might be asked for something like your passport, and also limit who has
access to the information you do choose to share.</p>
<p>If I want to be let into a building and am asked for my ID, I’m
answering the question “Who are you?”, when really the only thing I
should need to provide is the answer to “Are you allowed to come
in”.</p>
<p>Self-sovereignty of identity tries to make that distinction clear by
decoupling that information.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 68. industry players: digital identity (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image068.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Industry Players: Digital Identity"
  alt="Industry Players: Digital Identity." />

<p>One of the companies working on self sovereign identity (SSI) is
Vetri, formerly VALID.</p>
<p>Vetri’s model consists of a data wallet and a data marketplace.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can selectively reveal your data, therefore creating
scarcity in the data market, and you’ll be compensated in VLD
tokens.</p>
<p>uPort focuses on creating a persistent digital identity that
completely represents a person or organization that can make statements
about who they are.</p>
<p>It can be thought of as the ethereum equivalent of a facebook profile
in that you can log into services with it representing your
identity.</p>
<p>uPort’s app uploads your information to an independent decentralized
storage platform and maintains its address on the ethereum
blockchain.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sovrin’s model is a lot like uPort’s, but they custom built a
blockchain specifically for the purpose of identity, which scales a lot
better than the current iteration of</p>
<p>Ethereum, potentially allowing it to be used on a global scale.</p>
<p>Part of Sovrin’s mission is that identity should not be denied to
anyone for reasons of cost or accessibility.</p>
<p>The key of course to all of these, and what makes decentralized
solutions to identity useful, is that nobody should be in control of
your identity but you.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll be talking about blockchain’s applications in the
healthcare industry.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Healthcare</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 69. medical data: healthcare (163) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image069.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Medical Data: Healthcare"
  alt="Medical Data: Healthcare." />

<p>In the healthcare industry, blockchain can provide utility by
guaranteeing data persistence and availability.</p>
<p>Ensuring the integrity and accessibility of medical records is
extremely important, as it could literally save someone’s life.</p>
<p>However, this data should also be private.</p>
<p>Medicalchain seeks to tackle this problem by storing access to
medical data on the blockchain, only allowing access upon authorization
from the user’s mobile device.</p>
<p>It’s quite similar to a medical-focused uPort, except the data is
stored in the same place it is now - in the hospitals you visit.</p>
<p>Other groups using blockchains for medical data include MIT’s MedRec,
Taipei Medical University Hospital, and, surprisingly, Wal-mart, whose
product will allow EMTs to view the medical record of unresponsive
patients.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image070.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Incentivization: Healthcare"
  alt="Incentivization: Healthcare." />

<p>Blockchain is also particularly useful for providing financial
incentives for good behavior, which, interestingly enough, could have a
positive impact on the efficacy of modern healthcare.</p>
<p>Sweatcoin is an app that will pay you to walk, tracking your GPS
movements and counting your steps using technology already built into
your phone and rewarding you in Sweatcoins, which can be exchanged for
things like Paypal Cash, an iPhone, or product discounts.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but Sweatcoin purportedly has ‘converted’ some 2
trillion steps into cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Mint Health takes a similar, but more medical approach, providing
Vidamint tokens for good behaviors ranging from checking one’s blood
sugar to attending a health-related webinar, to recording steps.</p>
<p>These tokens can be exchanged for rewards such as lower insurance
premiums.</p>
<p>Insurance as an industry is also slated to be radically changed by
the blockchain.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Insurance</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 71. industry trands: insurance (165) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image071.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Industry Trends: Insurance"
  alt="Industry Trends: Insurance." />

<p>At the most basic level, insurance is something of a prediction
market - you’re placing bets based on the likelihood of some future
outcome.</p>
<p>This makes it a great industry to integrate with blockchain.</p>
<p>In an industry with so much fraud and inefficiency, companies need to
be able to make decisions based on data they can trust, and blockchain
can provide a very high level of security and transparency that would
provide such trust.</p>
<p>Accenture reports that 46 percent of insurers expect to integrate
blockchain within 2 years.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 72. industry projects: insurance (166) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image072.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Industry Projects: Insurance"
  alt="Industry Projects: Insurance." />

<p>A blockchain solution would allow the insured party to log their
claim and their evidence immutably on the chain and have it be validated
by the network such that the insurer can take it as truth.</p>
<p>Claims are a particularly dicey area of insurance - they take a long
time to process and always involve two parties with asymmetric
information that are at odds with one another.</p>
<p>A robust blockchain solution to fix claims might involve the use of
smart contracts that automatically dispense payments when a specific set
of requirements for a claim are met.</p>
<p>Aigang is exploring a solution like this - they are insuring smart
devices and automatically processing claims by having the devices log
their state on the blockchain.</p>
<p>They currently support insurance for phone batteries, and are working
on implementations for smart cars, smart homes, and drones.</p>
<p>Additionally, a group of European insurers have come together to form
the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative (B3i), which intends to use
blockchain to add security and transparency to current insurance
services.</p>
<p>Next, we’re going to look at how blockchain interacts with IoT.</p>

<h3>Use Case – Supply Chain (2:27)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 74. walmart and alibaba: supply chain (167) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image074.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Wal-Mart & Alibaba: Supply Chain"
  alt="Wal-Mart & Alibaba: Supply Chain." />

<p>With the rise of supply chains, many massive corporations have
attempted to incorporate blockchains into their own business models.</p>
<p>One example of this is Wal-Mart, which has decided to use a supply
chain for provenance.</p>
<p>Provenance is securing the traceability of specific objects by
tracking their history.</p>
<p>This provenance is done through a blockchain, where products are
traced through the companies they interact with, whether they are
growers, distributors, or retailers.</p>
<p>Along each stop of the way, those who are handling the products will
be required to create a transaction on the blockchain and sign them.</p>
<p>With this technology, rather than recalling all potentially affected
products when a subset of these products is contaminated, Wal-Mart can
use this supply chain to track where this illness came from and only
remove the products that came from the same source, thus saving a lot of
money, resources, and time.</p>
<p>Another massive corporation that has attempted to integrate supply
chain is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate.</p>
<p>Noticing that China has had an issue with counterfeit goods for
decades, Alibaba, among other e-commerce corporations, have decided to
mitigate this issue through the use of QR codes and RFID.</p>
<p>By tracking goods such as food, baby products, liquor, and luxury
items, the likelihood of being fooled by counterfeit goods is decreased,
while consumers are given more trust that their products are real.</p>
<p>Despite this, there is still plenty of skepticism against using
blockchain technology for provenance.</p>
<p>For example, many say that using blockchain serves no better than
simply using a centralized database, as the decentralized nature does
not give any beneficial advantage over a normal database.</p>
<p>Currently, Wal-Mart’s blockchain information is all stored on IBM’s
servers, which essentially defeats the purpose of a decentralized system
if all of the data is kept under a single central authority.</p>
<p>Another problem with supply chains includes the difficulty of tying
physical objects to the digital world.</p>
<p>For example, each bag of lettuce could be given a unique
identification code printed on the bag itself, but that can be easily
forged or changed at any stage of its life.</p>
<p>Walmart could use RFID tags on each of the bags of lettuce, but the
cost of this would far outweigh the potential gain, making it an
unreasonable solution.</p>
<p>Supply chains are unable to protect against many issues such as fraud
that can only be detected by human inspectors.</p>
<p>While a blockchain would allow us to trust the information channel,
the endpoints which input data to the blockchain are still fallible.</p>
<p>This endpoint verification problem, or, more informally, ‘garbage in,
garbage out’, is one of largest barriers to large scale blockchain
adoption today.</p>

<h3>Use Case:IoT (1:02)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 75. Security: IoT (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image075.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Security: IoT"
  alt="Security: IoT." />

<p>IoT devices collect and push data, and blockchains verify and codify
it.</p>
<p>Many of the use cases we’ve discussed so far involve smart contracts
making decisions based on parameters, such as for Aigang’s smart device
claim distributions, and the data collection mechanisms are often IoT
devices.</p>
<p>The biggest benefits blockchains bring to IoT are security and
trust.</p>
<p>Blockchains improve IoT security and trust by forcing the IoT network
to converge on truth, rather than have a single, potentially compromised
database providing false information for critical situations.</p>
<p>A lot of current IoT systems have a single point of failure, which,
when under attack, can result in catastrophic system failures like the
Mirai Botnet attack in 2016.</p>
<p>Groups such as the Trusted IoT Alliance aim to tackle these problems
by using blockchain to set standards for what a ‘good’ IoT node looks
like and quarantine nodes that don’t measure up, while distributing the
collected information from those devices to multiple sources.</p>
<p>Next, we will talk about blockchain in supply chain, which leverages
IoT as well.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Housing &amp; Real Estate (1:39)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 76. current issues: real estate (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image076.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Current Issues: Real Estate"
  alt="Current Issues: Real Estate." />

<p>Real estate is another industry being revolutionized by blockchain,
primarily when it comes to land rights.</p>
<p>Blockchain land registry projects have cropped up all over the world,
from Sweden to Ghana to India.</p>
<p>Current systems rely largely on paper deeds, which are extremely
frustrating to keep track of and are often lost for good, especially in
the wake of national disasters.</p>
<p>Additional problems arise when we consider forged signatures,
improper paperwork, and many other details that become important the
moment one wants to prove ownership or change it.</p>
<p>Lastly, corruption in governments and corporations can interfere with
property rights as they exist today in many countries.</p>
<p>What good is a land title if you can’t be confident that it is
available, persistent, and valid?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 77. solutions: real estate (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image077.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Solutions: Real Estate"
  alt="Solutions: Real Estate." />

<p>The blockchain solution is to create a hash of every land registry
and store that hash on-chain.</p>
<p>Only the person with the corresponding private key can claim
ownership of the corresponding land title.</p>
<p>The tamper-evident nature of cryptographic hashes and of blockchains
makes it impossible to change any part of a land title without alerting
the entire system.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the registry data is replicated in every node,
accessing to land titles cannot easily be blocked, be it by a malicious
attacker or a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Lastly, a blockchain land registry could drastically decrease the
amount of time it takes to transfer land.</p>
<p>Sweden’s Lantmäteriet, in conjunction with blockchain startup
Chromaway, said that their prototype cut a digital land registry’s lag
from 3-6 months to a few hours.</p>
<p>Some other companies looking into this include Propy, whose pilot
with a city in Vermont was launched earlier this year, and Zebi Data, an
indian blockchain startup partnering with the states of Maharashtra and
Telangana.</p>

<h3>Use Case: Foreign Aid (2:00)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 78. non-cash aid: foreign aid (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image078.png?raw=true"
  style="width:45%;"
  title="Non-Cash Aid: Foreign Aid"
  alt="Non-Cash Aid: Foreign Aid." />

<p>Last but certainly not least, blockchain can improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of foreign aid.</p>
<p>Today’s aid distribution systems are fraught with problems - many
intermediaries lie between the money you donate and the intended
recipient, and each one takes a cut, plus, if the destination doesnt
have adequate disbursement infrastructure, there’s no guarantee anyone
in need will see any of the money sent.</p>
<p>Blockchain can help with this.</p>
<p>Foreign aid can be divided into cash and non-cash aid.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about non-cash aid first, though they both benefit the
same way from implementing blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Non-cash aid systems that use blockchain include the United Nations
World Food Program, whose refugee camps in Jordan currently distribute
crypto-vouchers that can be exchanged by refugees for food and other
necessities.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, aid disbursement is heading in the
direction of cash aid, since it is more versatile and, thanks to
blockchain, can now be traced from sender to recipient.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 79. cash aid: foreign aid (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image079.png?raw=true"
  title="Cash Aid: Foreign Aid"
  alt="Cash Aid: Foreign Aid."
  style="width:45%;" />

<p>The problems of fraud and accountability are more severe for
providers of cash aid, since vouchers like UNWFPs aren’t necessarily
going to be usable by any intermediaries.</p>
<p>Implementing a blockchain and using it to transfer aid allows the
sender to see where all of the money goes, and the immutable nature of
the blockchain ensures that the transactions on chain have not been
altered.</p>
<p>Consensys Social Impact’s Project Bifröst goes as far as to cut all
unnecessary intermediaries out altogether.</p>
<p>Bifröst transfers aid as a stable coin (guaranteed to hold its
value), which is to be exchanged for local currency via kiosks in the
recipient country.</p>
<p>Having only two intermediaries drops the cost of transfer to as low
as 1% of the transaction value, significantly lower than any transfer
medium today.</p>
<p>Disberse, on the other hand, chooses to maintain an intermediary
network but instead demands strict accountability by logging each
transaction on chain.</p>
<p>They exchange the transferred cryptocurrency at local banks.</p>
<p>This concludes the specific use case section of this lecture.</p>
<p>We’re now going to dive into generalizations that can be made between
use cases.</p>
<h3>
Use Case Generalizations (8:25)
</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve seen all these use cases, let’s go ahead and finish
off with some generalizations.</p>
<p>These points can be used to understand and discuss any use case you
come across or come up with.</p>
<p>These points describe the properties of a good blockchain use case,
along with the scenarios in which a blockchain is not needed or inferior
to a centralized solution.</p>
<p>We’ve talked about these generalizations a great deal in the previous
course, but those were in the context of smart contracts and
applications of blockchain in general.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to consider use case generalizations in the context of
enterprise blockchain use cases.</p>
<p>Keep in mind everything you’ve learned up to this point, and see how
they fit into the generalizations.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80. Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties (175) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image080.png?raw=true"
  title="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties"
  alt="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>To start off, let’s talk about the scenarios where a blockchain will
work, but is not necessary.</p>
<p>We often hear the term “efficiency” in the context of blockchain use
cases, but this isn’t often applicable.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If I’m buying coffee, it’s less efficient to send Bitcoin and wait 10
minutes for a confirmation than to hand over a few dollars or use a
credit card.</p>
<p>However, it is more efficient to send value overseas with Bitcoin,
which takes a mere ten minutes in comparison to the days that banks take
to coordinate and the transaction fees they levy for international
transfers of value.</p>
<p>Hence, efficiency depends on context.</p>
<p>Additionally, characteristics of data storage such as data
immutability, integrity, auditability, and authenticity can be achieved
at much lower costs without a blockchain.</p>
<p>Redundant, mission-critical, fault-tolerant systems have been around
for decades, and cryptography has been around for millenia.</p>
<p>All of these properties have been solved individually.</p>
<p>Blockchain simply ties them all together.</p>
<p>Each of these bullets can be achieved by using a subset of the
technology that goes into making a blockchain.</p>
<p>While blockchains will solve any of these individual requirements,
they’re over-engineered solutions to these problems.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 81. Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #2 (176) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  title="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #2"
  alt="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As mentioned in several of the use cases, blockchains allow us to
solve coordination failures.</p>
<p>We are able to implement arbitrary incentive schemes, allowing us to
create a system which incentivizes individuals to operate according to
our expectations.</p>
<p>In addition, blockchain can be thought of as a “technological
solution to a social problem.”</p>
<p>Theoretically, every blockchain protocol could be run by a single
node.</p>
<p>However, you’ll notice the issue that if only one person runs the
protocol, then we lose out on the guarantees of auditability and
decentralized control, properties that are meaningful only in a social
setting.</p>
<p>When individuals don’t trust each other, then the blockchain allows
them to coordinate between each other without relying on some trusted
third party.</p>
<p>With this, blockchains can be used to make commitments, to fund
public infrastructure or do crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The network will force the actors to honor their commitments, as was
the original intention of smart contracts.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing in lawyers to settle matters when things don’t
according to plan, we’re now able to rely on a smart contract to execute
as intended, giving us the ability to believe in this code as law.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 82. Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #3 (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image082.png?raw=true"
  title="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #3"
  alt="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Blockchains create a standardized platform for access and
interaction.</p>
<p>Because of this, we can combine the power of all users on a
blockchain network to enhance everyone’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Given that all information in a blockchain is accessible to everyone,
we are now able to combine data silos between institutions.</p>
<p>Any information collected or functionality provided by an app on a
blockchain network is accessible to all other users on the blockchain,
something which can’t be said about the Internet alone.</p>
<p>In addition, blockchains enforce a common standard.</p>
<p>As all users tap into the same single protocol, they must also adapt
to that protocol’s specifications.</p>
<p>Granted, that requires everyone to go through the trouble of
adapting.</p>
<p>However, once everyone’s on the same platform, there are no longer
issues of format or syntax.</p>
<p>Lastly, by combining resources and information from all parties, we
can enhance everyone’s user experience.</p>
<p>Any app that exists on a smart contract platform has its data and
functionality living in that platform.</p>
<p>Any other app can leverage existing technologies on the same
platform, creating a positive feedback loop and benefiting all
involved.</p>
<p>This is referred to as network effects, which is the increased value
or potential of a product with every additional user.</p>
<p>Similar to how more Facebook users makes the platform more worthwhile
for all users, more smart contract developers increases the value of a
platform.</p>
<p>In this way, individuals are supporting the rest of the community
while benefiting themselves as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #4"
  alt="Blockchain Generalizations: Essential Properties #4."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Finally, the most abstract yet fundamental property of a good
blockchain use case is pure decentralization.</p>
<p>What this means is decentralization for the sake of keeping it out of
the hands of a central authority.</p>
<p>This is what Bitcoin aimed to do with banks.</p>
<p>Although there was a working central solution, Bitcoin wanted
decentralization nevertheless.</p>
<p>In countries with significant amounts of distrust in central
authorities due to corruption or inefficiency, as mentioned during the
real estate section, blockchain might be useful.</p>
<p>Blockchain provides a system for users to produce guarantees that a
central solution cannot provide, such as censorship-resistance and
disintermediation of power.</p>
<p>These properties are difficult to evaluate in terms of dollars and
cents, but groups like cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists ask about
finances second.</p>
<p>For some individuals, self-governance and privacy are more important
than any amount of revenue, making decentralization for
decentralization’s sake worthwhile.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most astonishing property that a blockchain provides is
globally recognized proofs.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies aren’t divided by lines or borders–they’re
guaranteed to be globally accessible and unstoppable as long as there
exists a community to support them, unlike businesses or government
projects.</p>
<p>Through blockchain, we can support globally recognized ownership,
persisting across nations.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve finished talking about all the meaningful properties
of decentralized solutions, it wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t go over
the caveats.</p>
<p>What are the costs of these properties of decentralization?</p>
<p>What do we achieve better with centralized solutions?</p>
<p>The overarching theme of centralized solutions is the benefit of
independence.</p>
<p>There’s no need for consensus when a single party has the power to
make decisions.</p>
<p>Because of this, we get the following benefits:</p>
<p>First and foremost we have deep integration.</p>
<p>A central solution has full control over everything under its
umbrella.</p>
<p>Apple is well known for taking advantage of this to control the user
experience.</p>
<p>When a blockchain attempts to upgrade its protocol, all users have to
voluntarily upgrade or get left behind.</p>
<p>With a central solution, however, it’s much easier to change
individual components or entire architectures of projects.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s much easier for a central system to patch up
bugs, such as security issues, than decentralized systems.</p>
<p>A central solution does what it needs to do, unrestricted, but a
decentralized system needs to come to consensus with thousands of
different actors to change anything at the protocol level.</p>
<p>Another huge advantage for central solutions is efficiency.</p>
<p>With centralized solutions, the cost of executing a program is about
a million times less work than decentralized solutions.</p>
<p>This is easy to see, as only one party is doing work, and it doesn’t
need to confirm the result of its work with anyone else.</p>
<p>In addition, only one store of data is required.</p>
<p>The data doesn’t be replicated across thousands of nodes.</p>
<p>In addition, access control is much simpler in a central solution,
where it’s much easier to restrict read and write permissions.</p>
<p>In a decentralized solution with censorship-resistance, we give up
that control.</p>
<p>Building off that, central solutions handle complexity well.</p>
<p>Imagine replicating Airbnb using smart contracts.</p>
<p>If a landlord finds their house destroyed, a blockchain can’t handle
that scenario.</p>
<p>How can an oracle accurately report whether a tenant damaged
household possessions?</p>
<p>Who would report that information?</p>
<p>It’s much easier to trust a single person to report on the state of
the house than to implement a complex and likely unreliable oracle
system.</p>
<p>Finally, central solutions are adaptive.</p>
<p>When an Uber driver is having trouble with their passenger, or the
other way around, who do they call for customer support on a blockchain
solution?</p>
<p>How do they get this issue resolved?</p>
<p>Centralized solutions have the advantage of handling messy situations
with grace, since you don’t need every single entity to agree on every
single outcome.</p>
<p>If you do integrate centralization with a blockchain solution, you
lose out on most of the benefits of decentralization.</p>

<p>The main takeaway is that there are advantages to both centralized
and decentralized solutions.</p>
<p>Neither is universally better than the other; they each have their
own use cases.</p>
<p>However, the best solutions are those that recognize when
decentralization is critical to accomplishing some goal and don’t get
distracted when a blockchain is viable but really doesn’t make
sense.</p>
<p>A good blockchain use case is like an oasis in a desert.</p>
<p>Mirages pop up all the time, but that doesn’t make them the real
deal.</p>
<p>Be sure that you’re able to justify why a blockchain works for your
use case!</p>
<h3>
Intro: ICO Schemes &amp; Culture (1:04)
</h3>
<p>Now you’re familiar with blockchain use cases and various examples
from around the world.</p>
<p>A question you might have asked a few times is, “How do these
projects get support and funding?”</p>
<p>The most popular kind of funding for blockchain startups within the
last year has been an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO.</p>
<p>You’ve likely heard of these before in news or from friends,
especially if you’re in the trading world.</p>
<p>Our goal in this section, however, is to provide a formalized,
analytical approach to understand the theory and caveats around
ICOs.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll take apart the culture and structure of
ICOs.</p>
<p>We’ll take a look at some standard ICO business models, what goes
into launching an ICO and maintaining its lifecycle, and some case
studies which demonstrate the difference between theory and reality.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll introduce some standards that have been suggested to
help bring order to this ambiguous and uncertain space.</p>
<h3>
ICO Schemes &amp; Culture (12:57)
</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 86. initial coin offerings: ico schemas and culture (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Initial Coin Offerings: ICO Schemas and Culture"
  alt="Initial Coin Offerings: ICO Schemas and Culture."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>An Initial Coin Offering, or “ICO,” is a novel, unregulated means of
raising funds for a blockchain startup.</p>
<p>It’s novel because this model did not exist before blockchain and
unregulated because blockchains lack the same strict governance that
centralized institutions are often bound to.</p>
<p>Companies developing a protocol often include a token within their
platform.</p>
<p>In order to distribute the token and also raise money for their
company, they will sell some amount of these tokens as seed funding.</p>
<p>These tokens often represent some unit of value within their
network.</p>
<p>However, it’s possible that these tokens are associated with the
company in name only.</p>
<p>The concept behind these tokens, regardless, is that their worth is
tied to the value of the company.</p>
<p>As the value of the company rises in value, then so will the demand
and, ideally, the value of the tokens.</p>
<p>Hence, the value can be defined by the amount of faith the community
has in the protocol’s Success.</p>
<p>The greater the faith, the higher the value.</p>
<p>This incentivizes the company to continue developing the protocol as
well so that the value of the token goes up.</p>
<p>A few ICOs which have happened in the past few years span a great
number of different projects, not limited to any particular
industry.</p>
<p>One example is Cosmos, a platform seeking to provide infrastructure
for blockchain interoperability, raising 16,800,000 in USD through their
ICO.</p>
<p>Another is Filecoin, aiming to create a distributed file storage
network, raising 257 million in USD.</p>
<p>We’ll see in a bit how much each industry has raised through
ICOs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="What is an ICO? ICO Schemas and Culture"
  alt="What is an ICO? ICO Schemas and Culture."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let’s take a deeper look at how ICOs innovate on previous fundraising
mentalities.</p>
<p>Previous kinds of fundraising, such as Venture Capitals, have often
been through a select group of accredited investors.</p>
<p>ICOs, however, allow for early adopters with a special interest and
understanding in a particular blockchain use case to buy into the
project early through the ICO, believing that it will come out on
top.</p>
<p>If the value of the ICO is tied to the value of the project, then
those with high confidence in the project due to background knowledge
will invest early.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the design.</p>
<p>This allows for project teams to get past an initial high capital
requirement to build out their protocol while circumventing traditional,
centralized fundraising models.</p>
<p>This allows developers to get a cash infusion, build out a protocol,
raise the value of the token, then give users the opportunity to use
these tokens to request services.</p>
<p>Ideally, this would align the incentives of the development team and
the early investors.</p>
<p>Both want to see their token holdings increase in value, meaning the
protocol needs to be developed as well.</p>
<p>However, as we’ll see, this is not the case today.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how ICOs might incentivize open-source
development.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 88. aligning incentives: what's your incentive? (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Aligning Incentives: What's Your Incentive?"
  alt="Aligning Incentives: What's Your Incentive?"
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Open-source development is typically led by foundations, such as the
Mozilla Foundation and Apache Foundation.</p>
<p>These foundations are dependent on donations and volunteers, as the
work is not funded as a company is.</p>
<p>Hence, there is a dichotomy between the value created and the
profit.</p>
<p>While many individuals develop open source software for the pure
ability to benefit mankind, incentivizing open source software
development could make it accessible to all around.</p>
<p>The remaining majority is incentivized to make the software
proprietary, causing technological lock-in.</p>
<p>Companies hide trade secrets from each other to keep their leg up,
slowing down intellectual growth.</p>
<p>ICOs now allow creators of open source projects to directly monetize
their efforts.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for donations after pitching to philanthropic
individuals their vision, individuals can now create a digital
representation of the value of their platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, as others build on top of that platform, the token will
further increase in value.</p>

  title="ICO Schemas: What's Your Incentive?"
  alt="ICO Schemas: What's Your Incentive?"
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What does the lifecycle of an ICO look like?</p>
<p>Well, let’s start with the assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, you’re building a blockchain project which requires some
kind of token.</p>
<p>In order to make your case clear for your project, you’ll need to
write up a whitepaper to outline your project and how tokens come into
play.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to decide on an ICO model.</p>
<p>ICOs have sparked interest in the term “tokenomics,” referring to the
economics of these digital tokens.</p>
<p>Because of the nascency of the space, several models are still being
explored and understood, all focused around manipulating a few key
variables and qualities.</p>
<p>For example, a question that arises is whether to have a fixed or
dynamic supply of tokens.</p>
<p>A fixed supply may limit the number of people who can buy into the
ICO, but a dynamic supply will make investors uncertain about the total
number of tokens to be sold.</p>
<p>Next, there’s the question about the number and types of stages to
the ICO.</p>
<p>Some projects have private fundraising rounds and pre-sales before
the public sale.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s the possibility of a dynamic price.</p>
<p>A fixed price is straightforward: for some particular stage, sell at
a set price.</p>
<p>However, some ICOs aim to have dynamic pricing depending on the time
and amount of tokens sold thus far.</p>
<p>For example, Gnosis, a smart contract prediction market project, used
what’s known as a Reverse Dutch auction.</p>
<p>In this fixed supply and dynamic price model, the price starts off
incredibly high at first, slowly decreasing, meant to encourage
investors to buy at the highest price which seemed reasonable to
them.</p>
<p>However, the team underestimated the initial valuation of the tokens:
approximately 12 million dollars worth of tokens sold out within the
first few minutes, accounting for only 5% of the supply.</p>
<p>This led to Gnosis owning approximately 95% of the total token
supply, leaving everyone confused.</p>
<p>This ICO, which happened early 2017, demonstrated how much more there
was to learn about tokenomics.</p>
<p>Third, after deciding on the model, it’s essential to determine the
regulatory and compliance laws by which your model must abide and which
are currently unsatisfied.</p>
<p>One question that might be asked is which countries legally allow for
your sale of token.</p>
<p>Another is whether the type of token makes a difference on
compliance.</p>
<p>If seriously considering launching an ICO, hefty legal counsel is
required to ensure that any and all regulatory concerns are handled.</p>
<p>Fourth, your smart contracts need to be written!</p>
<p>Every ICO is simply a smart contract or few which contain information
about the ownership of every token, along with the functionality to send
and receive tokens.</p>
<p>The first step of development is to implement the functionality
specified by your chosen ICO model, followed by inspecting the smart
contract for security issues and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Several smart contracts which hold money have been hacked in the last
few years, such as The DAO, leading to a great push for more smart
contract security checks.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll publicize your upcoming project and ICO to potential
investors to give everyone the opportunity to invest in your marvelous
project.</p>
<p>If that all works out, then you’ll get funding for your revolutionary
blockchain project!</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 90. Legal Uncertainty: ICO Schemas & Culture (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image090.png?raw=true"
  title="Legal Uncertainty: ICO Schemas & Culture"
  alt="Legal Uncertainty: ICO Schemas & Culture."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Legal uncertainty, as expected from so new a space, also permeates
ICOs.</p>
<p>Note that most of the legal precedents are still being established
both in the US and around the world, and what we offer is in no way any
legal, financial, or other advice.</p>
<p>Instead, we attempt to show you the current state of the
industry.</p>
<p>Leaders in the space, such as Coinbase, have written up material to
serve as guidelines for evaluating tokens.</p>
<p>Often, we find that ICOs are classified into two kinds of tokens:
security tokens, and access tokens.</p>
<p>Securities are financial investment vehicles, such as stocks in a
company.</p>
<p>Take The DAO, for example.</p>
<p>The SEC ruled that all tokens distributed by The DAO are considered
securities as they satisfied the criteria for a security.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have hesitated from selling to US citizens to
avoid crackdowns by the SEC.</p>
<p>On the other hand, access tokens are not meant to serve as any kind
of financial investment.</p>
<p>Instead, they simply serve as a way to access services, such as how
Kickstarter donations provide the user with access to early or special
goods from the team.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image091.png?raw=true"
  title="Aligning Incentives: Incentive Misalignment"
  alt="Aligning Incentives: Incentive Misalignment."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Another caveat to consider is the reluctance or even inability of
project teams to keep their promise after an ICO.</p>
<p>After all, after raising $200 million, what’s the incentive to do
anything else?</p>
<p>There is no VC or investor to demand money back–after all, the token
does not provide such a privilege.</p>
<p>Additionally, because most ICOs peak once and never recover to that
original value, early short-term adopters end up benefiting at the
detriment of long-term adopters.</p>
<p>In 2017, investors in ICO pre-sales tended to sell right away,
gaining 4 to 5 times returns on their investment instead of waiting for
the long term.</p>

  title="Aligning Incentives: Solutions"
  alt="Aligning Incentives: Solutions."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One proposed solution was for funds to be held in escrow, released
only when the team hits particular milestones, to incentivize them to
build out the project.</p>
<p>Hence, teams are less likely to abandon their promises.</p>
<p>However, then the problem of deciding who determines when milestones
are paid out arises as well.</p>
<p>This solution is not popularly used in ICOs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="ICO's A Double Edged Sword: ICO Schemas & Culture"
  alt="ICO's A Double Edged Sword: ICO Schemas & Culture."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Recall, the purpose of an ICO is to remove regulatory bodies from the
picture.</p>
<p>However, without regulation, regular users are at higher risk.</p>
<p>For example, thousands of investors bought into OneCoin, a
cryptocurrency in name alone.</p>
<p>This currency was purely run on SQL servers, entirely
centralized.</p>
<p>Everyone bought into it assuming there was a blockchain use case
underneath the project.</p>
<p>As most investors are unused to projects springing up into the public
eye without prior due diligence either by investment firms or by
government bodies, they may fall prey to scams such as this.</p>
<p>Additionally, ICOs ironically result in centralization.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, founders and early investors end up
disproportionately more wealthy than others, frequently the result of
“pump and dump” schemes, implying larger investors artificially raising
the price with the expectation of selling at a high value, leaving
everyone else to bear the consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, to demonstrate the success of scams in the ICO world, take
the project known as MIROSKII, raising over 70 million dollars in
funding without even having a real team!</p>
<p>In fact, unless Ryan Gosling is going under the pseudonym “Kevin
Belanger” and nightlighting as a graphic designer, his image was used
without permission as one of the members of the team.</p>
<p>Despite such a clear act of fraud, this project managed to obscenely
fill their pockets.</p>
<p>With the benefits of deregulation, such as larger freedom and
accessibility to a larger set of investors, also come the
consequences.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 93. limitatios of ico's: ico schemas & culture (194) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Limitatios of ICO's: ICO Schemas & Culture"
  alt="Limitatios of ICO's: ICO Schemas & Culture."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The new paradigm of ICOs don’t just have drawbacks for investors.</p>
<p>Project teams also miss out on crucial benefits compared to VC
funding.</p>
<p>VC funding requires high levels of discipline.</p>
<p>Investors seek out 10x, 100x companies – you’re not going to win
their approval with just a lousy whitepaper.</p>
<p>You’ll need detailed financials to prove your merit and have answers
to incredibly tricky questions about the fundamental assumptions of your
company.</p>
<p>VCs do due diligence on projects both for the consumer, but also for
the founders: if a VC agrees to invest in a company, then that person
has access to the VC’s vast set of connections and experience.</p>
<p>This can change the development of a project team.</p>
<p>ICOs, on the other hand, are nothing more than lumps of money.</p>
<p>They do not come with the support that a VC can provide.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 94. limitatios of ico's: ico schemas & culture #2 (195) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Limitatios of ICO's: ICO Schemas & Culture #2"
  alt="Limitatios of ICO's: ICO Schemas & Culture #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>This model of funding comes with many further drawbacks.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, there is no central or trusted party to carry
out due diligence on behalf of individual investors.</p>
<p>Instead of VCs carrying out the groundwork and governmental
regulatory bodies preventing clearly poor investment decisions from
reaching investors, ICOs are accessible to all.</p>
<p>This is a huge distinction between ICOs and IPOs: though IPOs require
years of scrutiny and thought for even the most well-established
companies, ICOs occur solely after a project idea and still raise
exorbitant amounts of money.</p>
<p>The burden of due diligence is now upon the investor.</p>
<p>But how many investors actually read the whole whitepaper?</p>
<p>How many investors look into each and every member of the team?</p>
<p>Because of this, lots of ICOs unashamedly use marketing strategies to
make the impression of profits for investors, even without any
significant technical knowledge to fulfill unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>Additionally, investors also tend to be of a particular mindset: most
early adopters already have a reasonably similar mindset, leading to a
lack of diversity in thought with the project founders, possibly
stunting growth.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also a much larger number of investors to appeal to
when launching an ICO, anywhere from hundreds to thousands, all of whom
have different demands and expectations from the project.</p>
<p>Because of this, managing relations with all these investors can
overwhelm small teams, a large reason why many companies prefer staying
private, to focus only on the few large investors.</p>
<p>Though ICOs provide tremendous access to funding, you know what they
say: “be careful what you wish for.”</p>

<p>In 2017, we saw ICOs overtake VCs as the most popular form of funding

<p>In 2018, we saw even more raised through ICOs, totaling 20 billion

<p>You may have noticed that this graph does not have the same generally
increasing trend as the previous year.</p>
<p>Instead, every third month seems to spike, followed by a couple
months of relatively less funding.</p>
<p>In fact, VC funding has recently surpassed 4 billion dollars, up a
great deal from 2017.</p>
<p>Since ICOs seem not to provide long-term returns and have lost credit
as a funding mechanism, VC funding is starting to surge.</p>

<p>You’ll see in this slide the distribution of funding.</p>
<p>As expected, the largest slice of the pie is infrastructure, at

<h3>
Intro: Regulations &amp; Caveats (0:43)
</h3>
<p>To conclude on the possibilities of this decentralized technology,
it’s important to come back to fitting it into the reality of
governments and popular culture.</p>
<p>The concepts of blockchains and distributed ledger technology are so
new that most countries have very little precedence to analyze this
space.</p>
<p>Additionally, what kind of regulations can or should be applied to a
technology resisting regulation by default?</p>
<p>The perspective and regulations on blockchain technology are
developing every day, but we’re going to try to introduce to you the
most accurate snapshot of present-day perception around the
technology.</p>
<h3>
Regulations &amp; Caveats (9:28)

<p>With handling money come several significant measures to prevent
illegal activity.</p>
<p>Money laundering refers to the movement of large sums of money
between borders or between the underground and legitimate economy.</p>
<p>Anti-money laundering laws aim to prevent these kinds of activities
by ensuring that every financial intermediary is aware of the source’s
and destination’s legitimacy.</p>
<p>You may be able to tell quickly why cryptocurrencies can cause
issues.</p>
<p>Blockchains not only circumvent centralized control but often contain
protocols to obfuscate transaction and user information, with Zcash
currently at the height of this.</p>
<p>In the United States, both the SEC and the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network serve to enforce these laws, placing restrictions
upon the types of activities that can be considered legitimate.</p>
<p>The exchanges which are under compliance of AML include Coinbase,
Kraken, and Bitstamp.</p>
<p>A good number of exchanges are not compliant given that a good amount
of the blockchain community diverges from regulation as much as
possible.</p>

<img class="displayed"

  alt="Know Your Customer."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Know your Customer regulations are another kind of regulation imposed
upon financial institutions to prevent knowingly or unknowingly enabling
illegal behavior.</p>
<p>For these reasons, KYC requires three things.</p>
<p>First, these businesses must identify and authenticate clients.</p>
<p>This is why you’re required to submit great swaths of personal
information to any bank with which you open an account.</p>
<p>This allows banks to confirm that you are who you say you are when
transferring and claiming money.</p>
<p>Additionally, it allows banks to associate any activity with a
particular individual or entity when noticing red flags, possibly
leading to further investigation.</p>
<p>Second, they are required to evaluate the risk of a client.</p>
<p>Each client may be holding and transferring to various entities
different quantities of money, some of which may not be legitimate.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the institution to determine beforehand
whether the client might represent a risk.</p>
<p>Finally, the institution must constantly watch for any indications of
criminal activity.</p>
<p>Often, a company will be forced to cut off business with a client who
may be behaving suspiciously for protection’s sake.</p>
<p>All these regulations are placed upon certain businesses to prevent
any kind of financial circumvention around restrictions.</p>
<p>However, because of blockchain’s decentralized nature, integrating
these qualities into businesses is socially difficult, though exchanges
like Coinbase will comply with these restrictions in order to be able to
serve audiences as large as possible.</p>

<p>Entities which deal with money transfer services or payment

activities, there exists the Money Transmitter License issued by states

<p>The process of achieving an MLT is sometimes known as a “financial
colonoscopy” due to the depth of the application process.</p>
<p>Some of the things that the New York Department of Financial Services
has done before giving a license to a bank include but are not limited
to auditing financial statements of the applicant business and any
subsidiaries, investigating the personal financial records of directors,
owners, and others, seeing a list of all lawsuits filed against any
“Control Person” in the last fifteen years, and performing third-party
criminal and civil background checks.</p>
<p>This depth of regulation is meant to protect consumers from
businesses mishandling their money, but it consequently makes performing
these services enormously difficult.</p>

<p>For a bit more perspective, let’s delve into some regulatory
history.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Winklevoss Twins, founders of the Gemini exchange and
well known for their involvement with the founder of Facebook Mark
Zuckerburg during their undergraduate study at Harvard, submitted a
proposal to the SEC to produce a Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund
known as the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>An ETF would allow anyone to buy and sell a representation of Bitcoin
without having to hold onto bitcoins themselves.</p>
<p>This proposal was rejected by the SEC in 2017, citing Bitcoin as
“unregulated” and not “consistent with the Exchange Act.”</p>
<p>A good deal of the blame was also put on poorly capitalized and
unregulated exchanges outside the US, with a particular influence from
the Chinese on the price.</p>
<p>One might say this rejection is not entirely bad.</p>
<p>After all, the entire purpose of Bitcoin is to be beyond regulation –
this ruling confirms that.</p>

<p>This slide demonstrates key arguments against proposed ETFs and
Mutual Funds intended for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Citing investor risk from extreme volatility, lack of liquidity, and
potential market manipulation, the SEC director as of January 2018 Daria
Blass says that the SEC does not believe that it is appropriate for fund
sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest
substantially in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Until Bitcoin receives a reputation for low risk investments, if it
ever will, it’s unlikely to reach widespread acceptance by the US
government as an underlying asset for financial products.</p>

<img class="displayed"

  title="Perspectives: States"
  alt="Perspectives: States."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Now that we’ve given some examples of regulation about
cryptocurrencies, let’s dive into some perspectives that can be offered
by states within the US.</p>
<p>Two states which have created pro-blockchain legislation include
Arizona and Vermont.</p>
<p>In Arizona, a bill was signed which allows blockchain digital
signatures to be considered legal signatures.</p>
<p>This implies that smart contracts are enforceable through the power
of the government in Arizona.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Vermont, information on the blockchain is considered
“representative of real facts and evidence permissible in court” as long
as it satisfies a few conditions.</p>
<p>This includes the date and time the information entered the
blockchain as well as whether the record was made by a regularly
conducted activity as a regular practice, which can be interpreted to
mean that a body with no trust is executing this record as it would any
other record, implying no bias in the inclusion or state of the record
into the blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, should it be legal for me to start my own private
blockchain and include a single transaction then claim it as evidence
within a court of law?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating to think that technology just reaching a decade in
age has already become powerful and popular enough to make its way into
legislation.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>To put cryptocurrencies and blockchain further into perspective,
let’s take a look around the world at some of the popular responses to
this new technology.</p>
<p>Though Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may be seen as a threat to
established institutions,</p>
<p>London particularly looks to give a more positive embrace to Bitcoin,
seeing the technology as progress for finance rather than buying into
fear that it will circumvent centralized systems.</p>
<p>Switzerland, already well known for its “Crypto Valley” in the city
of Zug, has looked into the development of a new type of banks called
“crypto-banks,” physical locations to do with your crypto what you’d
typically do with your fiat money.</p>
<p>This would redefine cryptocurrency startup perception along with how
banks go about handling these cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>South Africa has just recently started to see a rise in
cryptocurrency ownership and blockchain involvement.</p>
<p>The South African Reserve Bank, or SARB, established a Fintech task
force to monitor developments in the cryptocurrency and fintech space,
attempting to balance cryptocurrency and blockchain development within
the nation.</p>
<p>Though it has expressed that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be
considered currencies, the population is free to trade and use them as
they would any other asset.</p>
<p>The SARB even launched a project of their own in June 2018, known as
Project Khokka, built using JPMorgan’s Quorum to upgrade the South
Africa payment network and provide more insight into transactions
occurring between institutions.</p>
<p>Taiwan recently integrated a fintech regulatory sandbox into their
legislation, implying that even blockchain technology can be developed
by startups without fear of regulatory consequences.</p>
<p>Taiwan is popularly coined “Crypto Island,” with Jason Hsu known as
the “Crypto Congressman,” coined by Vitalik Buterin himself.</p>
<p>However, not all countries are as embracing of cryptocurrencies and
blockchain.</p>
<p>Here’s a few examples of countries pushing against cryptocurrencies
and blockchain.</p>

<p>In Bangladesh, it’s claimed that a lack of regulation by a central
bank makes cryptocurrencies dangerous.</p>
<p>While they’re not exactly wrong about the risk of cryptocurrencies to
unknowing investors, they certainly punish beyond what many might say is
a reasonable amount, threatening up to 12 years in prison for trading
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In Bolivia, the central bank issued a statement that it’s illegal to
use a non-government currency.</p>
<p>In China, bans have been placed on practically all cryptocurrency and
ICO-related activities.</p>
<p>In Ecuador, restrictions have been placed on virtual currencies as
well, primarily as a way to protect the national digital currency, the
first state-sponsored one in history.</p>
<p>Iceland claims that purchasing and transferring digital currencies
goes against the national restriction against currency leaving the
country, essentially banning cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>India shut down an exchange known as BTCXIndia which, despite
complying with AML/KYC regulations, still was deemed risky.</p>
<h3>
Text: Week 3 Summary
</h3>
<h3>
I. Enterprise Blockchain Overview
</h3>
<p>As Bitcoin and blockchain technology matured, banks and corporations
took interest in developing what are now known
as <strong>permissioned</strong> blockchains and distributed ledgers.
They aimed to “take the blockchain out of Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>Permissioned systems only allow trusted users into the system,
allowing for a reduction of key properties pushed by public blockchains,
resulting in systems with reduced levels of openness, no guarantee of
trustlessness, and fewer incentives built into the protocol.</p>
<p>Primarily, enterprise blockchains of the time were used to solve
issues in <strong>coordination failures</strong>,
boost <strong>horizontal integration</strong>, and
create <strong>self-sovereign</strong> decentralized networks. </p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 106. centralized & distributed databases (210) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  alt="There are two main catogories of databases: Centralized Databases and Distributed Databases. Within Distributed Databases, there is Distributed ledgers. Within Distributed ledgers, there is Blockchain."
  style="width:35%" />

<p><strong>Centralized databases</strong> are run by a single entity
(e.g. a company) that handles all requests and data processing.</p>

  src="./images/image107.png?raw=true"
  title="Incoming to Central Database"
  alt="Incoming to Central Database."
  style="width:35%" />

<p><strong>Distributed databases</strong> are run by a group of storage
nodes that are connected to each other and work to maintain a consistent
overall view of the entire system. Nodes are able to fully trust each
other in some systems (hence the solid lines connecting storage
nodes.)</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image108.png?raw=true"
  title="Incoming to Distributed Databases"
  alt="Incoming to Distributed Databases."
  style="width:35%" />

<p><strong>Distributed ledgers</strong> are a specific type of
distributed database in which the information is organized
chronologically, mimicking a traditional ledger. Most often, storage
nodes may not fully trust each other (hence the dotted lines in the
diagram below). Instead, they must implement some form of consensus
protocol to have a consistent view of the system.</p>

  title="Incoming to Distributed Databases"
  alt="Incoming to Distributed Databases."
  style="width:35%" />

<p>Distributed ledgers that specifically implement a chain of blocks in
their protocol are known as <strong>blockchains</strong>.</p>
<p>Blockchains exist in three broad categories, depending on their
access types: public, consortium, and private blockchains. Together,
consortium and private blockchains are known as permissioned ledgers,
since they require some level of permission granted – as opposed to
openly readable and writable public blockchains.</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="I">
  <li>Enterprise Blockchain Platforms</li>
</ol>
</h3>

<p>There exist many enterprise blockchain platforms today – too many to
mention in detail in this summary. The key things to look for when
evaluating whether a particular enterprise blockchain platforms is right
for a particular use case are:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Enterprise blockchain platforms usually specialize in particular use 
    cases, or have been used in the past to address certain use cases</p></li>
  <li><p>As they specialize in particular use cases, they make usage assumptions 
    that affect overall system scalability, security, and decentralization</p></li>
  <li><p>These properties are affected by the underlying consensus mechanism(s) an 
    enterprise blockchain platform supports</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>
  <ol start="3" type="I">
    <li>Use Cases &amp; Industries</li>
  </ol>
</h3>

<p>Enterprise blockchains are being used today in a number of different use cases, 
including: auto/mobility, finance, travel/tourism, digital identity, and supply chain.</p>
<p>In general, the essential properties of a good blockchain use case are that:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Blockchain is not only viable, but is <strong>necessary</strong>.
    Otherwise, it’s hard to justify a blockchain’s low “efficiency”</p></li>
  <li><p>Blockchain is used to <strong>solve coordination failures</strong>. 
    Blockchain could be used to create arbitrary incentive structures and enable 
	the cooperation of an untrusting consortium of companies and entities.</p></li>
  <li><p>Blockchain aids in <strong>horizontal integration</strong>. Since data 
    is now stored in a logically centralized blockchain, we can combine data 
	silos and enforce a common API and data standard.</p></li>
  <li><p>Blockchain achieves <strong>pure decentralization</strong>. This is not 
    as relevant to enterprise blockchains, but blockchain in general (public ones) 
	can be used to avoid centralized corruption.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Always keep in mind the advantages of centralized database solutions,
and think of whether they, or a subset of blockchain technology, could
be used to solve your business need – rather than an entire
blockchain.</p>

<h3>
  <ol start="4" type="I">
    <li>ICO Schemas &amp; Culture</li>
  </ol>
</h3>

<p>An<strong> initial coin offering (ICO)</strong> is a novel, “unregulated” 
means of raising funds for a blockchain startup.</p>
<p>ICOs are meant to allow developers to monetize open-source software despite 
the traditional incentive to make software proprietary. Additionally, it gives 
blockchain projects a much larger source of investors than only a relatively 
smaller set of VCs and other accredited investors.</p>
<p>However, ICOs also come with caveats. Because of a lack of regulation, scams 
are more capable of making their way into the view of investors, less doable when 
all investments were first screened either by VCs or government bodies, forcing 
investors to do more of their own due diligence. Additionally, many ICOs raise 
so much money that they have no incentive to actually finish up the project, 
leading to incentive misalignments.</p>

<h3>
V. Regulations &amp; Caveats
</h3>
<p>As the world has never seen anything like blockchain before, there
are still few regulations to specifically handle cryptocurrency and
blockchain related matters.</p>
<p>First, because cryptocurrencies are inherently deregulated, they not
only fail to abide by, but also may attempt to circumvent, laws such
as anti money laundering (AML) laws and know your customer (KYC)
regulations, leading to conflicts between regulatory bodies and
cryptocurrency projects and exchanges. Exchanges are required to acquire
licenses, such as a money transmitter license or a New York BitLicense
in order to provide services. Some governments have taken steps towards
regulating cryptocurrencies and blockchain, for better or for worse.
Vermont and Arizona have declared that portions of the information on a
blockchain can be considered legal evidence in court, but some countries
have taken steps to restricting access to cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h1 id="ch4">Cryptocurrencies for the Masses: Scaling Blockchain – Week 4</h1>

<p>Welcome to Week 4 of CS198.2x, Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>With all the blockchain use cases and ideas, one of the biggest blockers to 
their mass adoption is scalability.</p>
<p>Think back to the roots of blockchain.</p>
<p>If you took our first course, CS198.1x Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, recall 
that Bitcoin was born out of a dissatisfaction with centralized banks; it aimed 
to be the first global cryptocurrency, providing an alternative to banks.</p>
<p>However, fast forward to the current day in 2018, this is clearly not the 
case.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this lack of adoption is simply that Bitcoin and other 
mainstream blockchains are too slow.</p>
<p>And inherently, since many other blockchain systems were inspired by or are 
at least based in the same technology, they often times suffer the same 
scalability issues as well.</p>
<p>it’s clear that in order to bring cryptocurrencies – and other blockchain 
applications – to the masses, we need to be able to achieve scalability.</p>
<p>In this lecture, we’ll first look at what it means for a blockchain to be 
scalable, and what fundamental approached we could take to achieve scalability.</p>
<p>We’ll then learn from a naive scaling solution, and then take the lessons 
learned and apply them in analysis and design of new scaling solutions.</p>

<h3>Intro: Scaling Background (0:46)</h3>

<p>To fully understand what we want in our end goal for scalability is,
we must – as always – analyze the problem at hand from the top down, and
then seek to understand parameters and definitions.</p>
<p>The problem of scalability is especially so, since there are
potentially many ways to go about achieving scalability, and many
different tiers of improvement.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll go over what it means for a system to be
scalable, specifically by outlining the desired properties of a scalable
blockchain system, in terms of transaction volume and block time.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll look at how we can achieve those properties by
understanding fundamental systems scaling approaches and tradeoffs.</p>

<h3>Scaling Background (11:44)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~ 111. what is the scalability problem? scalability definition (217) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image111.png?raw=true"
  title="What is the Scalabilityroblem? Scalability Definition"
  alt="What is the Scalabilityroblem? Scalability Definition."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One property we look for when gauging the scalability of a blockchain
system is its ability to deal with an increased transaction volume.</p>
<p>To be scalable, a blockchain should be able to function with a higher
transaction velocity – so we’re looking for a higher TPS, or
transactions per second.</p>
<p>The definition here is pretty self explanatory in its name.</p>
<p>Being able to handle a greater volume of transactions per second
means that our blockchain system would be able to handle more
transactions with a higher velocity.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 112. what is the scalability problem? #2 (218) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image112.png?raw=true"
  title="What is the Scalability Problem? #2"
  alt="What is the Scalability Problem? #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Another property we’re looking for is the speed with which we can
update our distributed ledger – and in the case of blockchain, we call
this the block time: the average time it takes for a new block, or
update, to be appended to the blockchain.</p>
<p>And as with enabling a higher volume of transactions, the reason for
wanting faster block times is pretty easy to see as well.</p>
<p>If I’m buying a coffee with Bitcoin, there’s no guarantee that my
transaction will go through, especially with so many other transactions
floating around with potentially higher transaction fees.</p>
<p>You may know that the average block time in Bitcoin is roughly 10
minutes long, and generally when making a transaction, we would want to
wait six confirmations to be confident – with high probability – that
our transaction has gone through and has been finalized.</p>
<p>This isn’t scalable though, at least in the sense that I don’t want
to wait an hour every morning to get my coffee.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~ 113. what is the scalability problem? another consideration (219) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image113.png?raw=true"
  title="What is the Scalability Problem? Another Consideration"
  alt="What is the Scalability Problem? Another Consideration."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And one side note: as we know, blockchain is a decentralized
system.</p>
<p>As such, especially with large public networks, we want to lower the
barrier to entry if possible.</p>
<p>We’re aiming for decentralization, and a flat network topology is
preferred – one where anyone who wants to join can join.</p>
<p>One way we can do this is pay particularly close attention to the
size of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Historically, if there’s a high storage requirement for users to join
the network, then users might be disincentivized to join the network
completely.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they don’t have that much storage space, or perhaps
they just can’t justify using so much of their precious storage space
for a blockchain – which has no immediate value to them.</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, many users don’t want to run full nodes
since as of late August 2018, the blockchain is roughly 180GB.</p>
<p>Users can’t simply run a full node on their phone; and most users
won’t want to run a full node on their laptops or personal computers
either – due to the blockchain’s immense size.</p>
<p>And it’s become that size in only a couple years.</p>
<p>What happens if the blockchain’s around for another couple
decades?</p>
<p>Or even centuries?</p>
<p>If the blockchain continues to grow at the same rate it’s been
growing at, then it can very easily become very large and unmanageable
in the future.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for nodes to join the network in the
future, whether they be run by dedicated or casual users, we must design
blockchain systems keeping into account storage size.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 114. scalability: trilemma (220) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image114.png?raw=true"
  title="Scalability: Trilemma"
  alt="Scalability: Trilemma."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a scalability trilemma here.</p>
<p>This was proposed by Ethereum research, and claims that in any
blockchain system, we can only have two of the three properties shown
here: decentralization, security, and scalability.</p>
<p>We formalize the notion of decentralization by the amount of
resources everyone has, on average, in the network.</p>
<p>Decentralization in the case of the trilemma is the system being able
to run in a scenario where each participant in the network has access to
on average the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>Scalability is defined by a system’s ability to processes some
increasingly large volume of transactions at increasing speed.</p>
<p>Given everyone in the network has on average the same amount of
resources, how fast can we make the system?</p>
<p>Security is defined as a system’s ability to withstand attackers with
up to a certain amount of resources.</p>
<p>Potentially, they could have resources on the order of the total
number of resources in the network.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of formalisms, but it’s easy to see that tradeoffs are
inherent in these types of systems.</p>
<p>For example, if you increase the number of participants in a network,
the more we have to consider how including more transactions in a block
or speeding up the block confirmation time might cause security to
suffer.</p>
<p>Or if we want to make a system have much faster block times, without
adjustment anywhere else, we could suffer in security since faster
blocks means more orphaned blocks; and perhaps if someone has the right
amount of resources, they could tilt the system in their favor and so
decentralization would take a hit.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image115.png?raw=true"
  title="Transaction Size: Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Transaction Size: Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>To understand all of that more, let’s look at further detail and do a bit of math.</p>
<p>In the graph on the screen, we have the size of Bitcoin transactions over time.</p>
<p>The graph is a bit outdated, but the scalability concerns still apply.</p>
<p>We can see that on average, Bitcoin transactions have a size of around 546 bytes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 116. max transactions per second (222) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image116.png?raw=true"
  title="Max Transactions Per Second"
  alt="Max Transactions Per Second."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And here, we have a similar graph, but for Bitcoin block size.</p>
<p>The system was designed for 1 megabyte blocks, and we can see that
reflected in the graph.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 117. max transactions per second #2 (223) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image117.png?raw=true"
  title="Max Transactions Per Second #2"
  alt="Max Transactions Per Second #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Here’s a quick calculation based on the numbers we’ve collected so
far for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>From the previous slides, we have an average of about 546 bytes per
transaction.</p>
<p>The current blocksize is 1 megabyte.</p>
<p>And the block time in Bitcoin is 10 minutes on average.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can compute the sustained maximum transaction volume in
transactions per second.</p>
<p>By simple dimensional analysis, we have 1 megabyte per block, times 1
transaction per 546 bytes, times 1 block every 10 minutes, and we get a
final value of 3.2 transactions per second.</p>
<p>That’s not too hot.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image118.png?raw=true"
  title="TPS Comparisons: Bitcoin vs Modern Payments"
  alt="TPS Comparisons: Bitcoin vs Modern Payments."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Compared with some other traditional payment systems, Bitcoin is way
behind in terms of speed.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has an average of about 3 transactions per second, and we
just calculated in the previous slide that it has a max of 3.2
transactions per second.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Paypal has an average of 150 transactions per
second, with a maximum of 450 transactions per second.</p>
<p>And even more is VISA, which has an average transaction rate of
around 2,000 transactions per second, and has a theoretical high load of
56,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Comparing that to Bitcoin’s 3.2 transactions per second, the
difference is definitely quite drastic.</p>
<p>That was the situation at hand.</p>

<p>Suppose we now want to make our transaction rate comparable to that
of VISA, so we can finally realize our dream of using Bitcoin to buy
coffee and not wait an hour for the transaction to be finalized.</p>
<p>To increase our transactions per second, we have two fundamental
options.</p>
<p>Looking at the fraction transactions over seconds, it’s very easy to
see that in order to increase TPS, we could increase the transaction
volume, or decrease the block time.</p>
<p>And that’s just because TPS is directly proportional to the
transaction volume we have, and inversely proportional to that of the
block time.</p>
<p>To increase the volume of transactions, we could do this a number of
ways, we could either decrease the size of transactions, and thus be
able to fit more transactions into each block, given an unchanged block
time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could also increase the size of blocks, so that
each block could hold more transactions, and thus at each block time,
we’d have more transactions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to decrease the block time, there’s not much else
to say.</p>
<p>We increase the rate at which we create blocks.</p>
<p>There are definitely drawbacks and considerations for each of these
approaches, so that’s what we’re going to be looking into in later
sections.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 120. scaling techniques: how do we scale? (226) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image120.png?raw=true"
  title="Scaling Techniques: How Do We Scale?"
  alt="Scaling Techniques: How Do We Scale?"
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In terms of different techniques with which we can scale, there are
two fundamental options.</p>
<p>Setting aside blockchain scalability for now, and just looking at the
big picture of how we scale systems in general, we can see that we can
either scale vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>Vertical scaling, or scaling up, implies adding more resources so
that each machine can do more work.</p>
<p>Traditionally this is done by adding more memory, compute, or storage
to a particular machine.</p>
<p>Horizontal scaling, or scaling out, implies adding more machines of
the same capability, and to add more distributed functionality.</p>
<p>For example, imagine adding more machines to your compute cluster if
we’re talking about cloud.</p>
<p>And combining ideas from both vertical and horizontal scaling
simultaneously is diagonal scaling.</p>
<p>Applying this intuition to blockchain, we can categorize scaling
efforts.</p>
<p>For vertical scaling, there have been efforts to increase the block
size or decrease the block time.</p>
<p>There have also been alternative fork resolution policies to
Bitcoin’s longest chain wins policy.</p>
<p>For example, we have the GHOST, or greedy heaviest observed subtree,
protocol.</p>
<p>There’s the idea of setting up payment channels between particular
participants in the network.</p>
<p>For horizontal scaling, there have been many projects focusing on
sharding, a method of distributing a database, and also on sidechains,
as opposed to keeping everything on a singular blockchain.</p>
<p>And, finally for diagonal scaling, we’ve seen projects like Plasma
and Cosmos, which aim to not only make individual blockchains more
efficient, but also to create new value and connect these blockchains
together.</p>
<p>Besides the traditional standpoint of scaling up and out, there’s
another useful model to view scaling solutions, which is in layers.</p>
<p>Yep that’s right –– blockchains have layers.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 121. layers of scaling: blockchans have layers (228) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  title="Layers of Scaling: Blockchains have Layers"
  alt="Layers of Scaling: Blockchains have Layers."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>We’ll cover this part pretty quickly since it’s more insightful to
see examples of these solutions, but here’s a quick rundown.</p>
<p>Layer 1 scaling solutions refer to those that change the blockchain
and its protocol itself.</p>
<p>This could be modifying parameters of the blockchain – like block
size, block speed, the hash puzzle – changing a blockchain’s consensus
mechanism.</p>
<p>And these would all be layer 1 scaling solutions.</p>
<p>For example, if you remember from week 1, you might be able to
recognize that Casper the Friendly GHOST, Correct by Construction, is a
layer 1 scaling solution, since it would fundamentally change the
infrastructure and operation of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Layers of Scaling: Blockchains have Layers"
  alt="Layers of Scaling: Blockchains have Layers."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>On the other hand, we have layer 2 scaling solutions, which push
expensive computation off the blockchain.</p>
<p>This is also called off-chain scaling.</p>
<p>Generally, layer 2 solutions are easier to execute since they don’t
require a complete overwrite of the underlying blockchain like in layer
1 solutions.</p>
<p>For example, also from week 1, is Casper the Friendly Finality
Gadget, the Proof-of-Stake overlay on top of Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>And that’s a layer 2 scaling solution – it’s implemented simply as a
smart contract on top of the existing Ethereum infrastructure.</p>
<p>We’ll go into other examples of layer 2 scaling, some of which
include side chains and payment channels.</p>
<p>Going forward, we choose to organize blockchain scaling solutions as
vertical and horizontal as well as layer 1 and layer 2, so knowing the
distinctions are important in identifying solutions.</p>

<h3>
Intro: Vertical Scaling On-Chain (0:32)
</h3>
<p>So now that we have an idea and overview of the basic scalability
problem for blockchain, let’s start by seeing if we can design a simple
scaling solution.</p>
<p>We’ll use our previous analysis of the scaling problem to start
exploring vertical scaling options.</p>
<p>From there, we’ll be able to identify the shortcomings and strengths
of our solutions, providing a baseline for comparison with other scaling
categories and paving the way for more in depth analysis in current day
scaling projects and active areas of research later on.</p>
<h3>
Naïve Solution (2:45)
</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 123. naive solution: idea (230) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image123.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution: Idea"
  alt="Naive Solution: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The first idea we have for a naive scaling solution is to increase
the speed of blocks, thereby decreasing the blocktime.</p>
<p>If we’re on a Proof-of-Work system, we can do this by decreasing the
difficulty of the hash puzzle.</p>
<p>Like in Bitcoin, why is it set to be on average 10 minutes to find a
block?</p>
<p>Why can’t it be 1 second?</p>
<p>Or something insanely fast?</p>
<p>After all, decreasing block time is one of the methods of scaling
that we looked at earlier, right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 124. naive solution: idea #2 (231) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image124.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution: Idea #2"
  alt="Naive Solution: Idea #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The main issue we have here if we decrease the difficulty of the
Proof-of-Work problem, and thus the block time, is that the block
propagation time is still the same.</p>
<p>And the ratio of the block propagation time to the block creation
time is something that we must balance very carefully.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, we set the block time so high because we want to be
pretty confident that a good portion of the network sees a new block,
thus avoiding natural forks.</p>
<p>Research has shown that on average, it takes 6 seconds to send a
block to half of the network, and around 12 to 13 seconds to send a
block to 95% of the network.</p>
<p>Let’s say that we halve the block time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 125. naive solution: idea #2 (231) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image125.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution: Idea #2"
  alt="Naive Solution: Idea #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Firstly, decreasing block time means that the blockchain will grow
faster as well.</p>
<p>Let’s say normally for our blockchain system at a normal rate of
growth, it has size 5 gigabytes after 2 years.</p>
<p>If we halve the block time, then it would only take 1 year to make it
the same size, since we’re producing blocks twice as fast now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 126. naive solution: cons. natural forks (232) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image126.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution: Cons. natural forks"
  alt="Naive Solution: Cons. natural forks."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Now, with the decreased block time, it’s also more likely that
different blocks at the same height be produced by different miners in
the network, since they can find blocks faster than new blocks can be
relayed to them.</p>
<p>Thus, there would be many naturally occurring forks.</p>
<p>And even though we made the block time faster, we didn’t make it
faster to reach a good probabilistic finality.</p>
<p>Since natural forking is much more prevalent, we might instead have
to wait 12 confirmations instead of the normal 6 in Bitcoin, to ensure a
relatively high confidence in security.</p>
<p>And now someone who is clever might even look at the economics of the
current situation.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, it now makes more sense to withhold
blocks.</p>
<p>With the faster block times, it’s more likely that any given block be
orphaned because more people find solutions at the same time.</p>
<p>As a miner, you’re much better off withholding blocks, and building
your own chain, and publishing later.</p>
<p>We’ve covered this in the first course, CS198.1x in our section on
game theory and network attacks, but a malicious miner could take
advantage of this situation and mine selfishly, and then there could be
the potential for double spends.</p>
<h3>
Decrease Block Time
</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 127. naive solution revisited: cons size (234) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image127.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution Revisited: Cons Size"
  alt="Naive Solution Revisited: Cons Size."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What we were trying to do with our naive scaling solution was to
decrease the block creation time.</p>
<p>Size of the blockchain will increase regardless, since we’re assuming
blocks stay a constant size and have an increased velocity.</p>
<p>We’ll look at this problem later.</p>
<p>But what are some other outcomes of this naive solution that we can
take a look at with a more constructive outlook?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 128. naive solution revisited: cons natural forks (234) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image128.png?raw=true"
  title="Naive Solution Revisited: Cons Natural Forks"
  alt="Naive Solution Revisited: Cons Natural Forks."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Recall that another problem with the naive solution was that there
were a lot of naturally occurring forks.</p>
<p>With our standard fork resolution policy of taking the longest chain
as the canonical chain, we’d be wasting a lot of work if the block speed
increased.</p>
<p>All these orphaned blocks that are part of chains that weren’t in the
end the longest chain all represent work that was in the end wasted in a
sense.</p>
<p>The problem now is: how can we account for the existence of an
increased number of naturally increasing forks when we decrease the
block creation time?</p>
<p>How do we avoid wasting all of this work?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 129. ghost: idea (235) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image129.png?raw=true"
  title="Ghost: Idea"
  alt="Ghost: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Instead of just increasing the speed of blocks and doing nothing
else, the observant on here is that we can increase the speed of blocks
by specifically decreasing the difficulty of the Proof-of-Work problem,
and also by considering the Proof-of-Work chain with the most weight,
rather than simply the longest chain.</p>
<p>And that was the idea behind the GHOST, or greedy heaviest observed
sub tree, protocol, used in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work protocol.</p>
<p>The way it works is that in the GHOST protocol, blocks that are
orphaned are called uncle blocks.</p>
<p>And uncles up to 7 generations deep from the most recent block also
get block reward.</p>
<p>Specifically, uncle blocks get 87.5% block reward, and the children
of uncle blocks – appropriately called nephew blocks – get 12.5% block
reward.</p>
<p>And these blocks are used to calculate a chain’s weight.</p>
<p>In the end, GHOST reduces transaction time since the blocks are
faster.</p>
<p>It also decreases the incentive for pooled mining.</p>
<p>By rewarding uncle blocks, we’ve reduced the need for being exactly
the first new block on top of the longest chain.</p>
<p>Since block times are so fast, sufficiently fast miners would want to
reduce the overhead of communicating with pools anyways.</p>

  title="Ghost: Ethereum Average Block Time"
  alt="Ghost: Ethereum Average Block Time."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Ethereum had a period when it had 17 second block times, but now it’s
been more around 13, 14, 15.</p>
<p>If we round to a 15 second block time, then that means in 60 minutes,
the length it takes for 6 Bitcoin blocks to be created, Ethereum created
40.</p>
<p>And though it’s been the same amount of time – 60 minutes – for both
Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to add blocks, it’s clear to see that
40 confirmations in Ethereum might be more secure than 6 confirmations
in Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>
Increase Block Time
</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Blocksize Increase: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Another vertical scaling alternative we can achieve by adjusting
system parameters is by increasing block size.</p>
<p>The intuition here is that if we increase the blocksize, then we can
fit more transactions in a single block.</p>
<p>This could potentially be an easy implementation since we would just
need all miners to agree on the new standard to adjust the max block
size parameter.</p>
<p>It could also entail lower transaction fees for users, since with
larger blocks and generally a higher transaction throughput, there would
be less need for competition for getting your transaction immediately
included in the next block.</p>
<p>However, there are quite a lot of downsides to all of this.</p>
<p>First off, implementation would require a hard fork.</p>
<p>Blocks made by new clients with increase size would not be compatible
with older clients.</p>
<p>And hard forks like this generally would have a lot of political
debate over, and would probably split the community.</p>
<p>This is kind of a double-edged sword here, but lessened transaction
fees would not be good if you’re a miner, since that means you get to
collect less reward.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image132.png?raw=true"
  title="Blocksize Increase: Cons"
  alt="Blocksize Increase: Cons."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Another issue that might come up after implementing block size
increase would be that of deciding when block size increase should
end.</p>
<p>People are worried about block size increase being a “slippery
slope,” since it’s not clear when increasing the block size would
end.</p>
<p>And on the topic of increasing the block size further – it’s true
that block size increase improves the performance of the system, but
only linearly.</p>
<p>From our simple dimensional analysis calculation earlier on the max
transactions per second for Bitcoin, we got 3.2 transactions per
second.</p>
<p>Doubling the block size would only get us to around 6.4 transactions
per second – and that’s not even accounting for the other cons of
increasing block size.</p>

  title="Blocksize Increase: Cons #2"
  alt="Blocksize Increase: Cons #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Yet another con is that of longer propagation times.</p>
<p>A larger block would take longer to travel across the network,
naturally, since it’s more data to download.</p>
<p>Larger blocks would also take longer to validate.</p>
<p>This might give the authoring miner – the one who produced this block
– a better shot at creating the next block, since they’d have a head
start, and others would have to wait the longer propagation time for the
block to reach them.</p>
<h3>
Decrease Transaction Size
</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 134. decrease transaction size: idea (240) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image134.png?raw=true"
  title="Decrease Transaction Size: Idea"
  alt="Decrease Transaction Size: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Another alternative we mentioned earlier was that of decreasing the
size of transactions themselves.</p>
<p>The implication is that if we decrease the size of transactions, and
keep the block size constant, then we can fit more transactions into the
same size blocks.</p>
<p>And you can see that in the diagram below.</p>
<p>Both blockchains are 5 gigabytes after 2 years, but the one with
smaller transaction size has twice the number of transactions.</p>
<p>This solution is currently a bit more popular with people in general,
and we’ll be going over two main ways we can decrease transaction size,
which are SegWit and recursive SNARKs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 135. segregated witness: idea (241) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image135.png?raw=true"
  title="Segregated Witness: Idea"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>SegWit is short for Segregated Witness, and was originally created to
solve an issue in Bitcoin called transaction malleability, which we’ll
mention later on.</p>
<p>Beyond solving transaction malleability though, SegWit also allowed
Bitcoin to scale up by decreasing effective transaction size.</p>
<p>The way SegWit decreases transaction size is by separating – or
segregating – digital signatures from within each transaction.</p>
<p>Recall (perhaps from our first course) that signatures in Bitcoin
were kept in the scriptPubKeys.</p>
<p>The idea behind SegWit is that since digital signatures take up so
much space in each transaction, there’s no reason they need to be there
after they’ve been used for verification.</p>
<p>After all, after one use, the digital signatures don’t provide any
value, since they’re only there in the first place for recipients of
transactions to prove that they are authorized to spend from a previous
transaction output.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to keep the signatures except for the first time,
so let’s just remove all the signatures from the transaction data.</p>
<p>From previous sections, we saw that transaction size is on average
about 546 bytes, so if we can decrease that size, that would be
awesome.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 136. seg witness: avoid hard fork (242) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image175.png?raw=true"
  title="Segregated Witness: Avoid Hard Fork"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Avoid Hard Fork."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The idea for SegWit was to move the signatures to a separate add-on
structure outside of the scriptPubKey – to what’s called a segregated
witness.</p>
<p>In the diagram to the left, you can see that the signatures are
located at the end of the transaction, rather than in the input script –
the scriptPubKey.</p>
<p>New nodes would see the new scriptPubKeys that don’t contain
signatures and then know to look instead in the segregated witness for
the signatures.</p>
<p>Assuming the signatures are valid, then the transaction is valid.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 137. seg witness: avoid hard fork #2 (242) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image137.png?raw=true"
  title="Segregated Witness: Avoid Hard Fork #2"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Avoid Hard Fork #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Old nodes on the other hand would find these new scriptPubKeys and
think that whoever created the transactions are crazy.</p>
<p>Without the signature contained in the scriptPubKey like before, new
segwit transactions would seem to be unsafe, though the signature’s just
in a different place, where old nodes don’t know where to look.</p>
<p>But in the end, it’s not their bitcoin though, and other users are
free to do with their bitcoin as they please anyways.</p>
<p>So old nodes confirm the SegWit transactions as valid, and forward it
to other nodes.</p>
<p>As you can see from both cases: from the perspective of both old
nodes and new segwit-enabled nodes, the transaction was seen as
valid.</p>
<p>SegWit is compatible as a soft fork.</p>

  title="Segregated Witness: Mirror Signature Tree"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Mirror Signature Tree."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One issue now though is that because we segregated signatures from
other transaction data, the blockchain doesn’t have any evidence that
the correct signatures were included in their respective
transactions!</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>To fix this, Segwit also comes with a change to the regular merkle
tree structure of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Instead of having a merkle tree just with transactions,
SegWit-enabled miners construct merkle trees with one half transactions,
and one half the transactions’ segregated witnesses – in a sense
creating a mirrored merkle tree.</p>
<p>This way, we have information about transactions and their segregated
witnesses all contained within the block header, giving us back all the
beautiful properties of tamper evidence.</p>

  title="Segregated Witness: Pros and Cons"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Pros and Cons."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The pros and cons of SegWit.</p>
<p>These were debated quite a bit before SegWit was actually
implemented.</p>
<p>Firstly, SegWit fixes transaction malleability, which we mentioned
briefly before.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, unique transaction IDs are calculated by taking the hash
of a transaction, and before SegWit, that included the signatures.</p>
<p>The only way for attackers to change a transaction ID without
changing the underlying transaction is by changing the signatures.</p>
<p>And there are ways to change the signature, though it’s a bit out of
scope.</p>
<p>It’s a cryptographic vulnerability.</p>
<p>Since SegWit removes signatures from transaction data, signatures are
no longer used to calculate a transaction ID, thereby fixing transaction
malleability.</p>
<p>This allows further blockchain scalability solutions, such as the
Lightning Network and sidechains to work, both of which we’ll talk about
in the coming sections.</p>
<p>Another pro is that with Segwit, we have a soft fork instead of a
hard fork – compared with what would have happened if we just directly
increased the block size.</p>
<p>One of the main motivating factors for implementing SegWit was that
Bitcoin Core is generally very conservative, and would want to avoid a
hard fork at all cost.</p>
<p>And that’s what they did with SegWit.</p>
<p>Some other pros are that it’s not subject to slippery slope
arguments.</p>
<p>SegWit is a one-time fix; it’s not like you can just keep removing
data from transactions to decrease transaction size.</p>
<p>It’s not like what we could do with increasing block size, where
there wasn’t really a cap to how large we could make it.</p>
<p>Of course, the efficiency gains with SegWit are pretty nice.</p>
<p>Smaller transactions means that it’s less for miners to parse
through.</p>
<p>And we also have a smaller blockchain size for the amount of
transactions we want to represent.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image141.png?raw=true"
  title="Segregated Witness: Pros and Cons #2"
  alt="Segregated Witness: Pros and Cons #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As for cons, we know that SegWit is only a one time linear capacity
increase.</p>
<p>Since we can only remove signatures from transactions once, it’s not
like we can keep removing signatures right, so that’s where the one-time
comes from.</p>
<p>And the increase is only linear, because decreasing the transaction
size by removing signatures only increases the number of transactions in
a block linearly, with respect to the block size.</p>
<p>Another con is that in implementation, SegWit isn’t the
prettiest.</p>
<p>It’s proven to be very complicated and ugly, with over 500 lines of
code.</p>
<p>And compound the difficulty of implementation with the fact that</p>
<p>Wallets would have to implement SegWit as well, and that these wallet
software developers might not get their SegWit implementation right the
first time, or might take a while to upgrade especially if the team
behind it is small, and that could mean some losses for the average
Bitcoin user.</p>
<p>And finally, SegWit isn’t the only way to fix transaction
malleability.</p>

<p>The next on-chain vertical scalability topic we’ll cover hinges on
the concept of zero knowledge proofs, an advanced topic in
cryptography.</p>
<p>Zero knowledge proofs are a way to prove to someone that you know
something, without revealing what exactly you know.</p>
<p>The recipient of the proof has “zero knowledge” of what you know,
except for the fact that they know you know something.</p>
<p>You can think of it like how you authenticate yourself on websites
where you have to log in with a username and password.</p>
<p>If the website stored your actual password, that would be a horrible
security practice, since all it takes now is one data leak and now all
your user’s identities are compromised.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Recursize Snarks Scalability: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Instead, websites usually store a hash of your password instead.</p>
<p>If the password you input when you login hashes to the same string as
the website’s saved password hash, then you’ve been authenticated!</p>
<p>The website knows that you know your password, but they themselves
don’t know your password – only the hash of it.</p>
<p>Note that this analogy was to explain the concept of zero knowledge
proofs, and is NOT meant to be taken at any deeper level.</p>
<p>And with our high level understanding of zero knowledge proofs, we
can begin to understand zk-SNARKS, which stands for:</p>
<p>Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge – – a
pretty big mouthful.</p>
<p>Instead of Alice sending a transaction from Alice to Bob, she can
replace that transaction with a proof that she has sent a valid
transaction to Bob, and the corresponding changes to a virtual balance
sheet.</p>
<p>This is a lot smaller than the original transaction itself.</p>
<p>With the smaller size, and the way we construct and verify these
proofs, any machine in the network can verify the proof in
milliseconds.</p>
<p>That’s the main idea of zk-SNARKS</p>

  alt="Recursize Snarks Scalability: Improvements."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And it gets better; we can introduce a recursive structure!</p>
<p>A miner can merely include a single proof that they validated all the
other proofs and changes to the state of the network and everyone’s
balances.</p>
<p>Instead of having transactions inside blocks, our new block
construction would just have the following components:</p>
<p>(1) The root hash of the content of the ledger (2) proofs for all
valid transactions that have changed the ledger to the current state,
and (3) proof that the previous block’s proof was valid.</p>
<p>All in all, this would allow anyone in the world to verify the
blockchain in under 1 second, and also allows for twice as many
transactions per block.</p>
<p>The average transaction size we saw earlier was 546 bytes – and
compare this with the average proof size, which is 288 bytes.</p>
<p>For some closing thoughts, let’s look back at our previous slide.</p>

  alt="Recursize Snarks Scalability: Drawbacks."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Back to Alice and Bob, Alice generates a proof that she can send a
valid transaction to Bob.</p>
<p>She includes this proof and any changes to a balance sheet instead of
including a transaction, and any machine in the network can verify the
proof in milliseconds.</p>

<p>However, there do exist some pretty big drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, in practice, these proofs are very time consuming to
generate, and could potentially take hours.</p>
<p>Secondly, part of the proof construction requires a trusted setup
between computers.</p>
<p>Trusted setup, perhaps, like trusted execution environments, which we
discussed in week 1.</p>
<p>Ultimately the time it takes to generate proofs counteracts whatever
scalability benefits we saw earlier, with the reduced data size, and,
the trusted setup violates the trust assumptions especially in public
blockchains.</p>

<p>We’ve been playing with a bunch of parameters, such as block size,

<p>It’s clear that we need to change something else, but we’ve ran out
of parameters to play with.</p>

far are layer 1 scaling solutions.</p>

<h3>
Intro: Vertical Scaling Off-Chain (1:09)
</h3>
<p>Having explored the options of how to scale up by tuning existing
system parameters, let’s look at some more drastic changes.</p>
<p>Instead of making all these changes to the system itself, why don’t
we think a bit more outside of our current scalability formulation.</p>
<p>Why don’t we start thinking… off chain?</p>
<p>If the main struggle with blockchain scalability is that blockchains
are slow, why don’t we remove some of the more costly operations off
chain entirely?</p>
<p>We could keep operations off the main blockchain as much as possible,
perhaps only publishing to the chain only once in a while, when we need
a global sense of truth to play the role of a mediator or arbiter –
which is what the blockchain is best for anyways.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could also use this same idea of keeping operations off
chain, and have our operations on the actual chain represent a summary
or net result of all off chain transactions?</p>
<p>That’s what we’re going to be covering in this section on vertical
scaling by thinking off chain.</p>
<h3>
Payment Channels

<p>We’ve been referring back to Bitcoin a lot since it’s one of the
oldest and most popular blockchain systems, so it’s subject to a lot of
talk about scalability – especially since it’s been studied extensively
and many scalability solutions have been proposed for it.</p>
<p>Again, to recap Bitcoin, transactions have very long delays.</p>
<p>On average, 6 confirmations on a transaction will take 1 hour.</p>
<p>Transaction fees are also pretty inconsistent – historically during
winter 2018, becoming insanely high.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~ 151. recall: bitcoin transactions: issue with bitcoin payments (254) ~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Recall Bitcoin Transactions: Issue with Bitcoin Payments #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Here’s a graph of the daily transaction fees in US dollars per
transaction.</p>
<p>As you can see, in winter 2018, transaction fees spiked to 37 dollars
per transaction.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s around just a couple cents.</p>
<p>But the inconsistencies, and also the upper bound in the possible
transaction fees just comes to show that Bitcoin really isn’t economical
for low value items.</p>
<p>I drink a lot of coffee, and I don’t want to be paying up to 10 times
what I normally pay.</p>
<p>The idea here is that since transaction fees are so expensive,
clearly, just using the blockchain at all is expensive.</p>
<p>Why can’t two users Alice and Bob make payments between themselves
without always needing to consult the blockchain?</p>
<p>Perhaps they could transaction amongst themselves for a bit – perhaps
Alice is a regular customer at Bob’s coffee shop – and then only consult
the blockchain every once in a while to settle an aggregate amount.</p>
<p>After all, paying a single transaction fee for what was actually a
month’s worth of transactions for example would be pretty good.</p>
<p>We could call this a private payment channel – just between two
users, Alice and Bob.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Payment channel buildup: Private channels"
  alt="Payment channel buildup: Private channels."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>How would we actually implement a private payment channel between
Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>Well, they could maintain a private balance sheet, tracking each of
the transactions they conduct amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Initially, the private balance sheet would start off with however
much money both Alice and Bob have set aside.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, say Alice starts off with 10 bitcoins, and Bob
has 5 bitcoins.</p>
<p>After purchasing an extremely rare cup of coffee, Alice pays Bob 2
bitcoins, and they both agree to update their balance to the following:
Alice now has 8 bitcoins, and Bob has 7.</p>
<p>Say again that Alice is a regular customer at Bob’s super high end
coffee shop, and they’d like to settle their net balances weekly, so
they’d consult the blockchain then.</p>
<p>This way, they could avoid having to undergo the high fees and long
confirmation times of regular on chain transactions.</p>

  title="Payment channel buildup: Private channels #2"
  alt="Payment channel buildup: Private channels #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>This is how Alice and Bob’s payment channel would look like.</p>
<p>First, Alice and Bob open a private balance sheet, letting it be
known that this is the case on the blockchain.</p>
<p>They both start off with some initial balances.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob then make several private transactions amongst each
other.</p>
<p>When Alice and Bob want to close their private payment channel later
on, they publish it and their net balances on the blockchain.</p>
<p>We’d want to be able to create blockchain enforceable contracts
between users.</p>
<p>This could be done with smart contracts, and in Bitcoin’s case, be
written in Bitcoin script.</p>
<p>This way, we can encode the proper functionality so that neither
party in a payment channel can cheat the other.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>In blockchain, we call them payment channels, but we generally also
mean to specify the technical mechanism by which we achieve payment
channel functionality, and that’s with Hash TimeLock Contracts, or
HTLCs.</p>
<p>HTLCs use tamper evidence techniques to make sure that neither party
cheats, and for integrity of information, hence the H in HTLC, standing
for Hash.</p>
<p>The TL stands for TimeLock, and is the name for the mechanism by
which we can schedule an action in the future, for example the refunding
of transactions. Implementation details.</p>
<p>And we would like to implement this as a contract of some sort on a
blockchain system.</p>
<p>The goal of this all is to enable a bi-directional payment channel so
that both parties in a payment channel can pay each other with the
guarantees of a contract governing all actions – including incentives
for not cheating.</p>

  alt="Payment channel payments: Blockchain fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Let’s walk through a short little demo for a payment on a payment
channel.</p>
<p>Say two users Alice and Bob set up a payment channel, and this is the
initial state – state 0 – of their private balance sheet.</p>
<p>To do so, they need to create essentially a 2-of-2 multisig between
them, and each pay in their initial amounts.</p>
<p>For example, here, Alice has 10 bitcoins, and Bob has 0, for a total
of 10 bitcoins in this payment channel.</p>
<p>There exists an issue of trust within the payment channel though.</p>
<p>We don’t want to require Alice to completely trust Bob in the payment
channel, so we can design around that.</p>
<p>We won’t get too deep into the implementation details of HTLCs, but
suffice it to say that at any point in time, either Alice or Bob can
attempt to exit out of their payment channel.</p>
<p>What they need for this is to get both parties to agree, or to wait a
large number of blocks, say 1000 blocks.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 156. payment channel payments: blockchain fundamentals (229) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image156.png?raw=true"
  title="Payment channel payments: Blockchain fundamentals"
  alt="Payment channel payments: Blockchain fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Say Alice pays Bob 3 bitcoins.</p>
<p>Now we are in state 1, where Alice has 10 bitcoins, and Bob has
3.</p>
<p>Again, this is all done off chain, so for this transaction, neither
Alice nor Bob had to incur high transaction fees or long confirmation
times.</p>
<p>If both Alice and Bob are happy with their transactions, they can at
any point post back to the blockchain to settle their final
balances.</p>
<p>And this is done with each other’s signatures and secret
information.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to bring back the issue of trust, say Alice and
Bob don’t trust each other, and for good reason.</p>
<p>Alice paid 3 bitcoins earlier, but now she wants to revert back to an
earlier state, to before she paid Bob the 3 bitcoins.</p>
<p>She does this by attempting to exit the HTLC with their previous
balances.</p>
<p>However, the only way she can do this without Bob’s signature is to
wait 1000 blocks.</p>
<p>And at any time, Bob can see that Alice is trying to cheat him out of
his money, and then claim all the funds in channel – an incentive to
prevent cheating.</p>

  title="Payment channel conclusions: Goals reached"
  alt="Payment channel conclusions: Goals reached."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Now some key observations from our payment channel demo, and of
payment channels in general.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have a mechanism for countering cheating.</p>
<p>If Alice and Bob are in a payment channel and one of them try to
cheat, the other can always override and take all the money in the
deposit.</p>
<p>And that’s assuming at least one of the two will try to cheat the
other.</p>
<p>If Alice and Bob always cooperate, then they can stay in their
payment channel however long they like, and keep transacting.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob never have to touch the blockchain, except for when
they want to create the payment channel in the first place, and at the
very end – whenever they choose – to settle their final balances after
their series of transactions.</p>
<p>And, of course the main motivation for payment channels.</p>
<p>It enables huge savings in terms of how much we have to interact with
the blockchain.</p>
<p>We saw that the blockchain was inherently slow, and sought to use it
as infrequently as possible.</p>
<p>With payment channels, we only need two transactions on the
blockchain: one to initiate a payment channel, and one to settle the
final state.</p>
<p>With only two transactions on the blockchain, we can support any
arbitrary number of local transactions between two users Alice and
Bob.</p>
<p>And depending on how many times and how frequently Alice and Bob
transact, the scalability could be pretty high.</p>
<p>There remain some issues though.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 158. payment channel conclusions: issues (233) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image158.png?raw=true"
  title="Payment channel conclusions: Issues"
  alt="Payment channel conclusions: Issues."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Firstly, both participants Alice and Bob need to have capital locked
up in the HTLC before they can send money to each other.</p>
<p>And the money is locked such that it can ONLY be used in the HTLC,
meaning that if Alice transacts with many people other than Bob, then
she can’t afford to lock up all that she owns.</p>
<p>She has to make sure that she doesn’t run out of capital in the
existing HTLC.</p>
<p>If she locks up 10 bitcoins to begin with, and purchases a 2 bitcoin
coffee every morning from Bob, then she should probably look into
locking up more capital next time she and Bob enter a HTLC.</p>
<p>It’s the most benefit for the underlying blockchain that Alice and
Bob conduct as many transactions as possible off chain before settling
the final balance on the blockchain, since that was our main goal.</p>
<p>We would want HTLCs to have bi-directional payments as much as
possible.</p>
<p>And that ties right into another issue, which is that with the
payment channel enabled by an HTLC, we’re only making it easier for
Alice and Bob to send money between themselves.</p>
<p>What if Alice wants to send money to Charlie, but doesn’t have or
want a payment channel set up between herself and Charlie?</p>
<p>Especially if Alice only intends on transacting once or twice with
Charlie, it’s not worth to set up a payment channel.</p>
<p>We could potentially set up a network of payment channels.</p>
<p>As long as Alice is connected to Charlie somehow in the network, she
can send him money.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>The main problem we have to address here is that of security.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that capital is being transferred along the payment
channel network?</p>
<p>Well thankfully, with just some small additions on top of our HTLC
construction, we can trustlessly send money across a network of payment
channels governed by HTLCs.</p>
<p>And that was the innovation of the Lightning Network paper, titled
The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments,
written by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in early 2016.</p>
<p>What exactly are the scalability benefits of the Lightning
Network?</p>
<p>Well, if we assume that there is enough capital in payment channels,
then we can pretty much make payments instantly.</p>
<p>We don’t have to wait for confirmation times on the main blockchain
since we’re doing everything off chain.</p>
<p>Transactions could occur as fast as the communication delay across
the network, since as we saw earlier, if Alice wants to transact with
Charlie, her transaction might have to make several hops through other
payment channels in order to go through.</p>
<p>And since we’re only using the main Bitcoin blockchain as an arbiter
to settle disputes and to close out payment channels, we reduce the load
on the main bottleneck – the main Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>There would be far fewer transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<p>What this means is that instead of the 3 transactions per second that
we calculated in the earlier section, the Bitcoin network could
potentially support tens of thousands of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Since we’re delegating payments to simple bookkeeping that’s done in
each payment channel, we avoid the main bottleneck – the Bitcoin
blockchain.</p>
<p>And in practice, depending on the choice of when and between which
nodes to have payment channels, we could keep a very high percentage of
transactions, upwards of 99%, off-chain!</p>
<p>And keeping transactions off-chain not only increases the scalability
for the network as a whole, but it also has some nice outcomes for the
users as well.</p>
<p>First of all, transactions would be very fast, meaning that it’s now
feasible for me to get a coffee and not wait 60 minutes for the
confirmations.</p>
<p>Lightning Network transaction fees would be several orders of
magnitude cheaper than that of the normal Bitcoin network, since we’d be
doing everything off-chain.</p>
<p>And we’d only have to pay more expensive fees upon opening and
closing a payment channel – since these would be actual transactions on
the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>And in terms of speed, we’re only really limited by the packet
transfer overhead, and that’s not really an issue since it’s very
fast.</p>
<p>Instead of 3 tps, or 6 or 10 with incremental changes, we could
literally have tens of thousands of tps with the Lightning Network.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image162.png?raw=true"
  title="Lightning network scalability: Blockchain fundamentals"
  alt="Lightning network scalability: Blockchain fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>As great as the Lightning Network sounds, of course we have some
immediate issues we have to consider.</p>
<p>First of all, payment channels could be very expensive to
operate.</p>
<p>We identified earlier that payment channels could be a problem if
most payments occur only in a single direction; for example, if Alice
buys a coffee from Bob every morning, but Bob never pays Alice for
anything.</p>
<p>In these cases, nodes would need to keep very large amounts of
capital locked up in payment channels, to avoid running out of capital
in the payment channel and having to close it and open a new one with
more capital.</p>
<p>There’s also a tendency to strong centralization.</p>
<p>Only nodes with significant capital can afford to hold payment
channels for long, since they can afford to allocate a lot of capital to
each payment channel.</p>
<p>Larger payment channels would get settled less often on the main
blockchain, meaning that they could offer lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>Other users would see this and would want to use these payment
channels to avoid fees.</p>
<p>And so these payment channels controlled by more capital would get a
disproportionate amount of traffic.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s the realization that less capital is required
with less nodes on the network.</p>
<p>There’s a tendency towards a hub and spoke network topology.</p>
<p>Perhaps with large banks opening up many payment channels to other
banks or brokers, themselves with a lot of capital.</p>
<p>And from the perspective of Bitcoin’s values of decentralization,
this is probably not so good for the politically minded.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of payment channel networks isn’t limited to just
the Lightning Network for Bitcoin.</p>

<h3>
Intro: Horizontal Scaling
</h3>
<p>We’ve been discussing various vertical scaling techniques, where we
increase the performance of individual nodes, but what about horizontal
scaling?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be looking at modifying the blockchain
protocol itself to achieve better scalability.</p>
<p>For example, we’ll see how we can distribute work and network
topology such that each node does a subset of work.</p>
<p>We’ll take a look at aspects of horizontal scaling that are the topic
of current research, specifically sharding and side chains.</p>
<p>Then, in the next section, we’ll see how we can apply these
horizontal scaling solutions in more ambitious diagonal scaling
solutions.</p>
<p><u>Sharding &amp; Sidechains</u></p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 164. sharding: idea (238) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image164.png?raw=true"
  title="Sharding: Idea"
  alt="Sharding: Idea."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One way databases have traditionally been horizontally scaled is
through a strategy called sharding.</p>
<p>Sharding is the idea of partitioning, or distributing, data in such a
way that not every node in a network has the same copy of data.</p>
<p>This way, we’re distributing the load each node deals with, enabling
a type of parallelism through these horizontal partitions, which we call
shards.</p>
<p>As long as the union of all data across all the nodes in the network
is the state of the database we’re trying to emulate, then that’s
fine.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of deciding where to keep each piece of data.</p>
<p>You could imagine these individual nodes being in different
availability areas.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re designing a social media platform, chances are
the majority of the average user’s connections are within the same
general geographic area.</p>
<p>You could store all the data for users on the west coast in your west
coast datacenter, and the same for the east coast, midwest, or any other
general area.</p>
<p>More generally, if you don’t have any information about users’
geographic location, you could also distribute data based on an
arbitrary key.</p>
<p>In this diagram, we have the same data, but partitioned across our
shards not based on location, but on the user’s id.</p>
<p>It can be arbitrary how we do this, but to approximate load balance,
we could shard based on whether a user’s id falls under a certain range
of ids.</p>
<p>In the diagram, user_ids less than 500 are stored in the top shard,
and user_ids greater than or equal to 500 are stored in the bottom
shard.</p>
<p>Bridging back to blockchain, currently, in practically all blockchain
protocols, each full node stores all of the state data and processes all
transactions.</p>
<p>What we notice is that since every node has to process everything, it
creates a scalability bottleneck.</p>

<p>In the case of blockchain, sharding could be used to eliminate the
requirement that every validators or miner be working on every single
block.</p>
<p>As long as there are a sufficient number of validators or miners,
then the system would still be highly secure.</p>
<p>This way, with subsets of validators or miners working in parallel,
each focusing on a subset of transactions, we’d be able to greatly
increase a blockchain’s throughput.</p>
<p>In a sense, it’s a matter of parallelism.</p>
<p>Remember back to the original formulation of what horizontal scaling
actually is: where we’re adding more machines to an existing system to
speed it up via parallelism.</p>
<p>With sharding, we’re not necessarily adding more machines to the
system, but increasing the effective number of machines we have on each
portion of the blockchain – each shard.</p>
<p>If every machine has less to focus on, and continues to operate at
the same speeds, then there’s a scalability increase.</p>
<p>Sharding is unique in that it’s an on chain – or layer 1 – scaling
solution that is horizontal.</p>
<p>We’ll see later on that most horizontal scaling solutions are
achieved off-chain.</p>
<p>As with some of the other scalability solutions we’ve talked about,
as well as the ones yet to come in the following sections, sharding is
currently actively being researched.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 166. sharding: idea #3 (240) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image166.png?raw=true"
  title="Sharding: Idea #3"
  alt="Sharding: Idea #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Especially within the Ethereum research community, there’ve been
efforts to implement blockchain sharding.</p>
<p>While we won’t be diving too in depth into the implementations and
current research, one key observation we can make at a high level is
that of the data partitioning schema – and particularly what each node
in the network sees.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, there are now several levels of nodes that can exist
in a system that uses a sharded blockchain.</p>
<p>Within Ethereum research, they split nodes into four categories.</p>
<p>Super-full nodes, which store data from all chains,</p>
<p>Top-level nodes, which process all main chain – or top-level –
blocks, giving them light client access to all shards,</p>
<p>Single-shard nodes, which as evident by their name, store only
information from a single shard, and of course, your average user, who
is a light node, tasked only with downloading and verifying block
headers of the main chain.</p>
<p>With the separation of data and responsibility, there are many new
challenges to face when it comes to sharding.</p>
<p>For example, there’s the issue of how we can share information
correctly and succinctly between shards, and also the issue of how we
can maintain correct operation if a single shard has been taken
over.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image167.png?raw=true"
  title="Sidechains: Bitcoin Sidechains"
  alt="Sidechains: Bitcoin Sidechains."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>On a similar note, there’s also the idea of creating side chains.</p>
<p>The idea is that if we can’t speed up the main blockchain, why not
create multiple side blockchains that serve different purposes?</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, we could potentially have a faster and
less-secure blockchain for small transactions, such as purchasing
morning coffee.</p>
<p>A benefit to this type of architecture is that we would lower the
traffic on the main Bitcoin blockchain, and could have side chains for
different transactions, but all still pegged to the main blockchain as
an arbiter.</p>
<p>However, a downside might be that we would suffer a bit on the
security side since hashing power would be spread over multiple
chains.</p>
<p>And if every individual owns a larger proportion of a chain’s hash
power, that’s a prime target for large mining pools.</p>
<p>And if this is the case, there also needs to be countermeasures
against a compromised chain.</p>

<img class="displayed"

  title="Sidechains: Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Sidechains: Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>And here’s an idea of how sidechain networks would look like.</p>
<p>Each one of these circles is a side chain, with a unique purpose.</p>
<p>This specific image is from blockstream.</p>
<p>The proposal here in this diagram shows the main blockchain for a given system 
in the biggest circle in the middle.</p>
<p>On the left, there’s a side chain for beta and other pre-production releases 
of the blockchain system.</p>
<p>And on the right side, we could have side chains that enable features such as 
smart contracts, micropayments, real-world property registries, and others.</p>
<p>The key here is to transfer data reliably between different chains.</p>
<p>The intersection of each of these side chains is called a peg – specifically, 
a two way peg in our case.</p>
<p>They represent a virtual channel through which we can transfer assets at a 
deterministic and consistent rate – perhaps to maintain a stable exchange rate, 
if we’re moving funds between chains.</p>
<p>Implementations may differ greatly here, of course, but one big idea to take 
away is that pegged blockchains could potentially perform any function.</p>
<p>This opens the door for new features and horizontal scaling, but also of 
vertical scaling.</p>
<p>This could be done if we were to make and send transactions within a
faster side chain, and send back the results to a main slow
blockchain.</p>
<p>Ideas like these extend into the realm of diagonal scaling, which is
what we’ll be looking into next.</p>
<p><u>Intro: Advanced Scaling &amp; Generalizations</u></p>
<p>Now that we’ve understood the basics of vertical and horizontal
scaling, let’s see how we can apply them both simultaneously in
ambitious diagonal scaling solutions.</p>
<p>Following analysis of vertical, horizontal, and advanced diagonal
scaling tactics, we’ll have enough insight to make generalizations about
scaling in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>From there, we’ll see how they all compare in our ultimate goal of
bringing cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications to the
masses.</p>

  title="Diagonal Scaling: The Fourth State"

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Having discussed both vertical and horizontal scaling solutions,
let’s look at their combination: diagonal scaling.</p>
<p>Plasma extends on the idea of side chains which we explained in the
previous section.</p>
<p>Plasma is a child chain attached to the Ethereum main chain – also
known as the root chain.</p>
<p>In Plasma, security of off-chain transactions is derived from the
root chain.</p>
<p>The root chain is the main source of truth within the system, and
acts as an arbiter in the case of dispute.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 208. diagonal scaling: the fourth state #2 (276) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image208.png?raw=true"
  title="Diagonal Scaling: The Fourth State #2"
  alt="Diagonal Scaling: The Fourth State #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>A user’s interaction with Plasma might be as follows.</p>
<p>The user would first deposit some ETH into a Rootchain smart
contract, living on the main Ethereum network.</p>
<p>The initial deposit would show up as an unspent transaction output on
the sidechain.</p>
<p>This would allow the user to then send transactions around within the
Plasma – or child – chain.</p>
<p>At any point in time, the user could attempt to exit a UTXO on the
Plasma child chain back to the root chain.</p>
<p>An issue here is that we have to verify the validity of the exit; for
example, maybe the user is trying to exit a UTXO that has already been
spent.</p>
<p>To disincentivize malicious exiting, we require exiting users to post
bond, and also implement an exit challenging mechanism.</p>
<p>If we detect malicious exiting, the user’s posted bond will be
slashed.</p>
<p>If nothing is wrong, then the exit is finalized.</p>
<p>In either case, the result is posted on the root chain, which serves
as the source of truth.</p>

<p>Plasma is being developed by Blockchain at Berkeley’s FourthState
Labs.</p>
<p>You can find a link to them on this slide, and also at
github.com/fourthstate.</p>
<p>Plasma’s been getting a lot of attention recently, and for good
reason.</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin himself had stated that Plasma, in conjunction with
sharding – complimentary layer 2 and layer 1 scaling solutions – could
potentially scale Ethereum transaction speed up by 10,000 times.</p>
<p>And speaking of layer scalability, the Plasma specification says
nothing about where and how to host a child chain, so it’s up to
implementation.</p>
<p>The Fourth State team had a clear vision of interoperability in their
Plasma implementation, and chose to build their child chain
implementation on Cosmos.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Here’s a picture of our team getting a well deserved shoutout at the
4th Global Blockchain Summit 2018.</p>
<p>We consider Plasma a diagonal scaling solution because it scales up
the number of Ethereum transactions that the network can handle by
bringing transactions off the main chain onto child chains, which could
be used to extend Ethereum’s functionality.</p>
<p>And this is especially the case if you view Plasma with a particular
sense of modularity.</p>

<p>Plasma is one component of the larger scalability ecosystem.</p>
<p>We saw this back with Vitalik’s hopes of Plasma plus sharding.</p>
<p>And with the Fourth State team’s implementation of Plasma on Cosmos,
it especially opens up the door for interoperability.</p>

<p>Before introducing Cosmos from the scalability perspective, it’s nice
to take a step back and understand the primitives upon which it
functions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, you can view blockchains with three main abstraction
layers.</p>
<p>There’s the application layer at the very top that processes
transactions and updates the state of the system, and defines the
distributed application that you’re building.</p>
<p>This could be peer to peer electronic cash, or general smart contract
computation, or any other use case.</p>
<p>Below that, there’s the need for a consensus layer, to make sure that
the entire network agrees on transactions and updates made to the
underlying distributed database.</p>
<p>And below that, there’s the network itself, tasked with propagating
transactions through the network, making sure all nodes are getting
updates within reasonable time.</p>
<p>In the early days, developers directly forked the Bitcoin codebase
for the lower levels of consensus and networking.</p>
<p>This worked for a bit, but was inflexible, especially for
applications that required increasingly specialized architectures,
distinguishing themselves from Bitcoin’s standard UTXOs, Proof-of-Work,
scripting language, etc.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Diagonal Scaling: Internet of Blockchain"
  alt="Diagonal Scaling: Internet of Blockchain."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Then, with the advent of Ethereum, writing blockchain applications
became simpler than ever, since you could now just write your smart
contract very succinctly in a high level language, running on the
Ethereum network and consensus layers.</p>
<p>Again though, this still tied the fate of smart contracts to the
state of the Ethereum system – and since scalability hasn’t been solved
as of yet, this is currently still an issue.</p>
<p>Then, the goal of the Tendermint project was to create a fully
modular blockchain middleware that provides networking and consensus
layers.</p>
<p>This allows arbitrary applications to be built on top of Tendermint,
with the ABCI, or application blockchain interface.</p>

<p>An advantage of this modular design is that of flexibility, which
lends itself quite naturally to the idea of the Cosmos Network an idea
to connect blockchains together – to become an internet of
blockchains.</p>
<p>Blockchains in the Cosmos network would be diagonally scaled.</p>
<p>We can achieve vertical scaling by the speed of Tendermint BFT
consensus, and horizontal scaling by the interoperability of the Cosmos
network itself.</p>

<p>We won’t dive too in depth here, but the general topology of the
Cosmos network consists of hubs and zones, each either running
Tendermint or having a data transform layer.</p>
<p>Hubs connect multiple zones together, and hubs and zones are all
blockchains supporting their own applications, whether they be simple
payment blockchains, or a full fledged port of Ethereum onto
Tendermint.</p>

<p>With consideration of blockchain ecosystem rearchitecting, such as
with Tendermint and Cosmos, it’s a good segue now to mention the topic
of week 1.</p>
<p>Alternative consensus mechanisms also provide a pathway to
scalability.</p>
<p>Tendermint BFT allows for thousands of transactions a second with
100+ validators.</p>
<p>And many other blockchain systems sporting novel consensus mechanisms
also claim to have solved scalability too.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s due to the specificity of their intended use case, and
some trust or security tradeoffs.</p>
<p>It’s hard to tell at this point, so as an aside, as always, please do
your own research in this.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to reflect on what we’ve learned this week.</p>
<p>We started off by analyzing the pressing issue at hand – that Bitcoin
and other similar blockchains have an inherent scalability issue.</p>
<p>If the goal is to have these blockchains be used on a global scale,
they need to support global transaction volumes; many many orders of
magnitude greater than what most mainstream current blockchain systems
can support.</p>
<p>There’ve been many scalability proposals, but beyond scalability
alone, there’s also other issues of security and trust and
decentralization, all factors in community adoption – the ultimate goal,
really.</p>

  title="Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems &amp; Consensus"
  alt="Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems &amp; Consensus."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Upon understanding the scaling problem, we saw some fundamental ways
to scale blockchains.</p>
<p>Through simple dimensional analysis, we saw that we could either
increase the volume of transactions or decrease the block time.</p>
<p>We also recognized that choosing the direction in which to scale is
important too – for example if we just want a performance boost, what
kind of numbers are we looking at, and what order of magnitude
difference is it?</p>
<p>The other question is whether instead to extend our blockchain
outwards, adding new features.</p>
<p>There’s also the decision of where these scaling solutions can be
built – for example on or off chain – and the corresponding trust
implications that follow.</p>
<p>The blockchain is the main source of truth, but it’s perhaps the main
bottleneck as well, since it has to process so much information all the
time.</p>
<p>And through our further analysis, we saw that the scalability problem
was definitely more difficult that it seemed originally.</p>
<p>Some miscellaneous concerns stem from the fact that scalability is
not black and white.</p>
<p>Perhaps in scaling up, we need to consider what exactly we want
blockchains to do.</p>
<p>At a higher level, there’s scalability decisions to be made in terms
of whether we want to engineer blockchains for speed first – optimizing
for a single application – or rather architect for flexibility – for a
potential blockchain platform or network.</p>
<p>And pervading through all this of course is politics – whether
certain blockchains want to scale up at all.</p>
<p>A trilemma we brought up towards the beginning of this week’s
material stated that scalability is just one aspect of blockchain
functionality.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Scalability Trilemma, revisited"
  alt="Scalability Trilemma, revisited."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Perhaps a blockchain would rather focus on security or
decentralization, rather than scalability.</p>
<p>There are inherent tradeoffs between these three properties, such
that it’s harder to maintain decentralization and security, especially
if we want to scale up so much – in fact, through most of the latter
scalability solutions, there was usually some change in the regular
blockchain trust structures.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Again to summarize what we’ve learned, let’s tie back to the two main
ways of quickly categorizing scaling solutions.</p>
<p>There’s the layers of scaling – layer 1 and layer 2, specifying
whether solutions are built on-chain or off-chain.</p>
<p>There’s also vertical and horizontal scaling – with diagonal scaling
being a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Let’s step through all of the scaling solutions we learned.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 221. scalability summary: quick categorization #2 (286) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image221.png?raw=true"
  title="Scalability Summary: Quick Categorization #2"
  alt="Scalability Summary: Quick Categorization #2."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>First, we tried tuning on-chain parameters for vertical scaling.</p>
<p>We specifically looked at decreasing block time and increasing block
size.</p>
<p>These solutions seemed to be very naive at first, but further
analysis brought us to solutions such as GHOST protocol, as implemented
in Ethereum, mitigating the effect of wasted work on a system with fast
block times.</p>
<p>Here, we started looking at more involved scaling solutions, which
involved complex engineering rather than just naively tuning parameters
on chain.</p>
<p>We then looked at Segregated Witness, a method by which we can
decrease the effective size of Bitcoin transactions by moving signature
information from the inside of transactions to a separate structure – a
Segregated Witness.</p>
<p>Recursive SNARKS on the other hand, could allow us to prove the
existence of transactions, without storing the transactions themselves
in a block.</p>
<p>And the storage savings between these proofs and transactions is
pretty high, though there are some issues with trusted setup for
verification of these proofs.</p>
<p>Then, we looked at other ways to scale vertically.</p>
<p>Realizing that there’s only so much we can do with our current
blockchain systems as they are, we looked to layer 2 – to achieve
scalability off-chain.</p>
<p>The first off-chain solution we looked at was vertical scaling via
payment channels.</p>
<p>We could lock up funds pairwise between users, and conduct an
arbitrary number of transactions off chain, and then only post to the
main chain when the users want to settle on a final balance – all
summarized by two transactions on the main blockchain.</p>
<p>But this only works pairwise between users.</p>
<p>It becomes expensive if I want to conduct only a few transactions in
this manner with someone else.</p>
<p>Then came the idea of having networks of bidirectional payment
channels</p>
<p>Enabling transactions between any two nodes in the network,
traversing through a series of payment channels.</p>
<p>Implementations of such include the Lightning and Raiden Networks,
for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectfully.</p>
<p>Then, we looked at ways to scale horizontally.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are few horizontal scaling solutions that are
also on layer 1, and sharding is by far one of the most researched and
supported within the community.</p>
<p>Alternatively, horizontal scaling can also be achieved through
side-chains, pegging many individual blockchains together, to expand
their ease of interoperability, within protocol.</p>
<p>The potential of side-chains also extends very naturally to diagonal
scaling as well, especially depending on the types of applications
supported on side chains.</p>
<p>We then looked at Plasma, a proposal for Ethereum that has gained
traction to work in conjunction with sharding.</p>
<p>Plasma can increase the transaction volume of Ethereum, since we can
reduce the load on the root Ethereum chain, and peg to that a child
chain.</p>
<p>This is when we realized that we could combine multiple complementary
scaling solutions together.</p>
<p>As it turns out, given Plasma’s open specification, and how
implementations of Plasma, such as Blockchain at Berkeley’s Fourth
State, have taken liberty in deciding how and where to run their child
Plasma chains, it’s easy to see how Plasma can scale blockchains out as
well.</p>
<p>Especially, building Plasma child chains on Cosmos enables modularity
and flexibility.</p>
<p>In Cosmos, hub and spoke blockchains create a network of
interoperable blockchains.</p>

<p>And finally, with Tendermint’s integration within the Cosmos network
and other modular blockchains, as well as in general novel alternative
consensus mechanisms and the like, we realize that we can go back and
scale blockchains vertically on chain once again.</p>

<h3>Text: Week 4 Summary</h3>

<h3>I. Background</h3>

<p>Modern day public blockchains have been victims of their own success.
Bitcoin and Ethereum especially are having scalability issues in that
they aim to be global networks able to support global-scale transaction
volumes, but currently both perform subpar in the transaction
throughput.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, scaling solutions can either increase the transaction
volume, or decrease the block time. This is self evident as scalability
is measured in a blockchain’s achievable TPS (transactions per
second.)</p>
<p>Going forward, we can classify blockchain scaling solutions two ways.
The first is a rough comparison with traditional cloud architecture
scaling classifications: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Secondly,
there are the blockchain-specific scaling classifications: layer 1
(on-chain) and layer 2 (off-chain).</p>
<p>II. Vertical Scaling</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 223. tps calculation equation (290) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image223.png?raw=true"
  title="TPS Calculation Equations"
  alt="TPS Calculation Equations."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Bitcoin processes less than 10 transactions per second, and without
any scalability upgrades, it’s bound to stay at low TPS. Looking at how
we calculate TPS in the first place, namely in the rough dimensional
analysis above, we can see that the fields we can attempt to modify in
efforts to create new scaling solutions are:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Block time</p></li>
  <li><p>Block size</p></li>
  <li><p>Transaction size</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These parameters are all built into a blockchain system itself, and
tuning these parameters directly constitute as layer 1 scaling
solutions.</p>

<h3>II.I. Decrease Block Time</h3>

<p>We can’t simply decrease the block time of a blockchain system, since
that would result in a higher rate of naturally occurring forks,
reducing system security. This is because while block time decreases,
the time to propagate a block remains the same.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 224. time to create block (290) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image224.png?raw=true"
  title="Time to broadcast block fixed while block creation time decreases"
  alt="Time to broadcast block fixed while block creation time decreases."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Ethereum has dealt with this problem historically by employing the
GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree) protocol. With the GHOST
protocol, miners no agree on the longest chain to be canon (as in
Bitcoin), but rather the chain with the most “weight”, where weight is a
value calculated by both a chain’s length and the number of uncle blocks
it has. </p>

<h3>II.II. Increase Block Size</h3>

<p>Increasing block size would improve a blockchain’s TPS. Since a block
can now contain more transactions, it would also lower transaction
fees.</p>
<p>However, as with decreasing block time, there are some side effects.
For one, increasing block size would imply hard forking, and depending
on the community, this could be a less than pleasant experience. It
would also make the blockchain grow in size at a much faster rate – a
problem decreasing the block time also faced. And finally, increasing
the block size is most likely not a one-time fix, since the scalability
boost is only linear. The block size might need to be increased in the
future again, leading to a “slippery slope” type of debate.</p>

<h3>II.III. Decrease Transaction Size</h3>

<p>Segregated Witness (SegWit) was an upgrade to Bitcoin that move
transaction signatures from within the transaction to a separate
structure at the end of the transaction, called the segregated witness.
To non-SegWit nodes, this would be a decrease the effective transaction
size since they wouldn’t know to read into the segregated witness.</p>
<p>Non-SegWit nodes would see a transaction without a signature, but
would mark the transaction as valid. SegWit nodes on the other hand
would know to read into the segregated witness, and would verify it
using the signature.</p>
<p>SegWit was originally designed to solve transaction malleability in
Bitcoin. It also is implemented with a soft fork, and results in a
smaller blockchain size. However, SegWit is only one time linear
scalability boost.  </p>
<p>Recursive SNARKs also decrease transaction size. Instead of storing
transactions themselves in the blockchain, we could instead store proofs
that these transactions have indeed occurred, and the final balance
sheet of who owns however much cryptocurrency. This leads to efficiency
gains by decreasing transaction size, and also because machines can
verify proofs within milliseconds. However, currently, a trusted
environment setup is required in order to produce these style of proofs.
And proof generation in practice is very costly.</p>

  <li><h3>Vertical Scaling Off-Chain</h3></li>
</ol>

<p>Given that the speed of a blockchain limits its scalability, we can
consider entirely removing the more costly operations off the chain and
only publishing when we require a global sense of truth.</p>
<p>Payment channels in Bitcoin could be implemented using HTLCs (hash
time lock contracts), and could move transactions off the main Bitcoin
blockchain and onto side chains. If Alice and Bob transact often,
perhaps it makes sense for Alice and Bob to construct a private payment
channel, where they conduct their transactions off-chain. Only when they
want to settle their final balances do they post back to the main
blockchain. This allows Alice and Bob to still conduct their
transactions as they do, but the main blockchain only has to store Alice
and Bob’s initial and end balances. </p>
<p>The idea behind the Bitcoin Lightning Network is to create a network
of payment channels</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>In the diagram above, Alice can pay Charlie without having a payment
channel to Charlie directly, so long as there is a path from Alice to
Charlie through the payment channel network.</p>
<p>Ethereum has a similar scalability solution in the works,
appropriately named Raiden.</p>
<p>Payment channels and payment channel networks would allow us to keep
many transactions off chain, delegating payments to simple bookkeeping.
Since the main blockchain only sees the start and end balances of the
parties in a payment channel, we can keep a majority of transactions off
chain: scaling Bitcoin from under ten transactions to potentially
hundreds of thousands of transactions.</p>
<p>Some problems include having to lock up capital in order to initiate
a payment channel, and centralization concerns of payment channel
networks converging to hub-and-spoke topologies.</p>

<ol start="4" type="I">
  <li><h3>Horizontal Scaling</h3></li>
</ol>

<p>Sharding is database scaling strategy that breaks up a monolithic
database into “shards”, each a separate database that contains data from
a subset of the original database, whose union is the original database.
The same idea can be applied to blockchain, and is currently one of the
active areas of research in Ethereum research.</p>
<p>The idea translated to blockchain implies that not every node keeps
track of every block. It would be a layer 1 horizontal scaling solution.
We could have multiple blockchains running in parallel, each containing
a subset of all transactions. Issues currently being researched include
the classification of various nodes in a sharded blockchain system (e.g.
nodes that see a single shard vs nodes that see all shards), cross-shard
communication, and defenses against single shard takeovers.</p>
<p>Sidechains are the idea that you can create multiple side chains for
different purposes that plug into a main chain, effectively decreasing
the traffic on it.</p>
<p>This does separate hashing power across multiple chains, which raises
security concerns.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a sidechain setup:</p>

<h3>V. Advanced Scaling &amp; Generalizations</h3>

<p>Ethereum’s Plasma can be seen as a diagonal scaling solution, since
it enables horizontal scaling by implementing side chains and vertical
scaling by increasing their speed through Tendermint and alternative
consensus mechanisms. The security of off-chain transactions is derived
from the root chain, the main source of truth within the system.</p>
<p>FourthState, a team comprised of Blockchain at Berkeley’s members,
wrote an implementation of Plasma using the Cosmos SDK, enabling further
flexibility and scalability. </p>
<p>Blockchains have 3 main abstraction layers, from top to bottom: </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The application layer processes transactions and updates the state of the system</p></li>
  <li><p>The consensus layer makes sure the entire network agrees on transactions and updates to the database</p></li>
  <li><p>The networking layer makes sure all nodes get updates within a reasonable amount of time</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the Tendermint project is to provide the networking
and consensus layers so that arbitrary applications could be built on
top of it. Tendermint is the consensus “engine” of the Cosmos network,
which aims to make blockchains interoperable and scalable. </p>
<p>The following table summarizes the scaling solutions we have learned,
categorized by 2 different methods. Layer 1 and Layer 2 specify whether
solutions are built on-chain or off-chain. Solutions can also scale
vertically or horizontally.</p>

<h1 id="ch5">Anonymity, Mixing and Altcoins - Week 5</h1>

<p>A great advantage offered by cryptocurrencies over fiat money
alongside censorship-resistance and decentralized control was the
advantage of user privacy.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, many conversations within the space seem to
have been focused on issues that affect all users, such as global
scalability, and enterprise blockchain solutions rather than placing an
emphasis on privacy.</p>
<p>Recall that the Cypherpunks, though great inspiration for the
principles of Bitcoin, aren’t as often referenced as enterprise leaders
when talking about cryptocurrencies and blockchain.</p>
<p>Arguably, extensive privacy has always held a place within a more
niche audience because of its difficulty to directly monetize.</p>
<p>Mostly everyone wants a scalable cryptocurrency, since scalability is
required for the tech to be usable and accessible on a large scale, but
not everyone cares about sacrificing performance for privacy.</p>
<p>For example, the number of people who would go out of their way to
use cryptocurrency to obscure their identity in the first place is
limited.</p>
<p>This week, we’ll be examining the benefits and costs of privacy, how
we can achieve privacy through anonymity, along with how
cryptocurrencies and blockchains can enhance privacy for their
users.</p>

<h4>Announcements</h4>

<p>Welcome back to week 5 of CS198.2x Blockchain Technology. This is the
second-to-last week of this course. Besides the usual quick check and
quiz questions, we also have two assignments.</p>
<p>The homework for this week will be preparation for the final
homework. This week’s homework is to research a specific blockchain of
your choosing (not counting the ones excluded in the official assignment
specification). You will post 1-2 paragraphs of material about the
chosen blockchain on the discussion boards. If someone else has already
posted about the blockchain you’ve chosen, you are to add onto their
post rather than create your own, aiming to provide new information
rather than repeat what’s already been said. By analyzing an existing
blockchain protocol and reading over the research that other students
have done, you’ll be prepared for the final assignment.</p>
<p>For the final assignment, you will be designing your own blockchain,
and justifying each of your design choices (e.g. consensus mechanism,
defense mechanisms, scalability, security &amp; privacy,
decentralization). This will be due at course end, Nov. 9 at 0:00 UTC,
to give you extra time to write. We advise you to start as soon as
possible. </p>

<h3>Intro: Anonymity Basics</h3>

<p>Privacy has become a huge point of contention in recent days with
tech organizations such as Google and Facebook, which make a great deal
of revenue from monetizing user data, coming into conflict with
regulatory bodies such as the European Union.</p>
<p>Clearly, there exist questions in terms of privacy and user
experience.</p>
<p>What are the tradeoffs when using efficient and integrated
centralized systems in exchange for giving up vast amounts of personal
information?</p>
<p>And how does this apply to cryptocurrencies and blockchains?</p>
<p>In blockchains, each person has a set of identities with which they
interact with the blockchain.</p>
<p>This means that a user’s privacy will be reduced if their virtual
identities can be linked to their real one.</p>
<p>Hence, they can increase their privacy through anonymity, masking
their identity, allowing them to gain access to some service while
minimizing how much information they reveal about their real
identity.</p>

<h3>Anonymity Basics</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 228. anonymity basics: blockchain fundamentals (298) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image228.png?raw=true"
  title="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>When thinking of anonymity, your mind might jump to secret
organizations, such as the hacker group Anonymous or the inventor of
Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>You might ask, “Is anonymity only reserved for criminals and
rebels?</p>
<p>Might anyone else want anonymity?</p>
<p>Is anonymity in Bitcoin – or in cryptocurrencies and blockchain in
general – only good for buying drugs?</p>
<p>If I have nothing to hide, why go out of my way to stay
anonymous?”</p>
<p>Anonymity is not about hiding illicit information as much as it is
about protection, which, as most don’t realize, applies to anyone and
everyone.</p>
<p>We’ll go ahead and show some examples of how anonymity can apply to
even the average person.</p>
<p>Imagine it’s just any other day.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 229. is anonymity only for drugs? splitting the bill (299) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image229.png?raw=true"
  title="Is Anonymity Only for Drugs? Splitting the Bill"
  alt="Is Anonymity Only for Drugs? Splitting the Bill."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>You’re with your friend at McDonald’s ordering food, and it’s time to pay.</p>
<p>McDonald’s refuses to split the bill, and you forgot to order
separately, so you volunteer to pay for the both of you.</p>
<p>Your friend sends you some cryptocurrency later on to pay you
back.</p>
<p>Some time passes, and you decide to go to Bob’s Burgers to make a
purchase with your friend’s cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>However, Bob’s Burgers doesn’t accept your payment because your money
is associated with drug dealers.</p>
<p>Turns out your friend has been making some shady purchases, and the
cryptocurrency associated with these transactions made its way to your
wallet.</p>
<p>Not only is this bad because now you’d have to question your friend,
but this also affects the cryptocurrency’s fungibility.</p>
<p>Fungibility is the idea that every unit of currency must be equal in
value to every other unit.</p>
<p>Like in dealing in cash for example, a dollar is a dollar.</p>
<p>Fungibility is a crucial property of currency, and to see it impacted
this much in such a scenario shows that we probably want to enable
anonymity.</p>
<p>When vendors refuse to accept one unit of cryptocurrency over
another, it reduces the fungibility of the currency and makes life
harder for you too.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Is Anonymity Only for Drugs?  Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Is Anonymity Only for Drugs?  Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Now let’s consider a more drastic example.</p>
<p>Say you’re super wealthy, and the same McDonald’s store cashier now
sees that you’re sitting on a stash of $60 million in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>When they kidnap your mom next week, they know exactly how much money
to blackmail you for.</p>
<p>Pretty scary huh?</p>
<p>Even though you did nothing wrong, the exposure of the information
about your transaction history and financial standing put you in
danger.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 231. cypherpunk movement: bitcoin's genesis (301) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Cypherpunk Movement: Bitcoin's Genesis"
  alt="Cypherpunk Movement: Bitcoin's Genesis."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Taking a step back, we can look at the origin of Bitcoin and
blockchain to gain some perspective.</p>
<p>We know that cypherpunks were individuals who advocated for privacy
using cryptography, and that Satoshi Nakamoto appealed to this mentality
with the publishing of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and subsequent
release in 2009.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was designed as the first ever decentralized, pseudonymous,
and trustless system for transactions, and the way it achieved that was
with a blockchain.</p>
<p>Initially, in designing Bitcoin, its creators wanted to get as far as
possible from having any central entity, so they intended for every
entity in Bitcoin to have the ability to be just as powerful as anyone
else.</p>
<p>They allowed anyone to store the blockchain.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image232.png?raw=true"
  title="Recordkeeping: Everyone's the Bank"
  alt="Recordkeeping: Everyone's the Bank."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>What this means though is that everyone has everyone’s data.</p>
<p>Users can see which addresses interact with each other, how much
cryptocurrency each address has, and the like.</p>
<p>Considering the normal user which may not go out of their way to
obfuscate their digital identity and activities with additional
protection, it’s easy to see how their transaction history and balance
can be exposed to their detriment.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 233. anonymity basics: blockchains are not anonymous (302) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image233.png?raw=true"
  title="Anonymity Basics: Blockchains are Not Anonymous"
  alt="Anonymity Basics: Blockchains are Not Anonymous."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>It’s clear that blockchains are not anonymous by default.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, blockchains take a central database and distribute
it.</p>
<p>However, this now means that you no longer have strong access control
over your own data.</p>
<p>All of the data stored in the blockchain is public by default, so
everyone sees everything – there’s no sense of guaranteed privacy.</p>
<p>One note is that private or permissioned blockchains are slightly
more anonymous since read access to the database can be restricted.</p>
<p>The focus of this week’s material is on public blockchains, since the
challenges of privacy in publicly readable databases are much more
difficult and novel.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier with the creation of Bitcoin and addresses, now
in terms of anonymity:</p>
<p>Most blockchains are not anonymous.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 234. anonymity basics: blockchain fundamentals (303) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image234.png?raw=true"
  title="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Instead, most blockchains are pseudonymous.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image235.png?raw=true"
  title="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain and Not Anonymous"
  alt="Anonymity Basics: Blockchain and Not Anonymous."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In most blockchains, we use a publicly viewable but arbitrary
identifier, such as your Bitcoin address.</p>
<p>However, keeping your real name out of your identifier does not
guarantee anonymity.</p>
<p>These identifiers, like your Bitcoin address, are called
pseudonyms.</p>
<p>A pseudonym only implies that a user is not using their real
identity, such as their name, email, or other personally identifying
information.</p>
<p>As such, it is very well possible to have this pseudonym linked to
some real-world identity.</p>
<p>For example, because all transactions are public on the blockchain,
if even a single transaction by some Bitcoin address is linked to an
actual identity, all other transactions conducted under that pseudonym
are now connected to the real identity as well.</p>
<p>All histories of transactions and any other activity that has been
recorded on the blockchain all originally had no connection to a real
person and only to a pseudonym.</p>
<p>However, with one single connection between a pseudonym and a real
life identity, everything in their history can now be linked to the
person that that identity belongs to.</p>
<p>Therefore, most blockchains, including Bitcoin, are pseudonymous.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 236. anonymity basics: linking (305) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image236.png?raw=true"
  title="Anonymity Basics: Linking"
  alt="Anonymity Basics: Linking."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In Bitcoin, and some other blockchain platforms, it’s generally best
practice not to reuse pseudonyms.</p>
<p>You could generate a new address every time you receive Bitcoin
without much cost.</p>
<p>With a different address for each transaction, there will be no way
to link each of these Bitcoin addresses together.</p>
<p>This separates the activity of each pseudonym.</p>
<p>Hence, for someone to figure out all your Bitcoin activity, they’d
have to connect you to each of your pseudonyms, not just an individual
one.</p>
<p>This would be like creating a new reddit account every time you leave
a comment.</p>
<p>Although it is more inconvenient to do so, it increases the
difficulty of linking your accounts together, making it much harder for
others to track your activity.</p>
<p>This does introduce the slight hitch that one would have to keep
track of each of these identities, but that can be easily resolved using
wallet software, which often performs this by default.</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Just generate a new address every time you receive any
cryptocurrency, or each time you use any sort of blockchain
application!</p>
<p>While this technique might be possible in Bitcoin and some other
blockchain applications, it’s not possible in Ethereum.</p>
<p>And that’s because Ethereum is account based, not UTXO based.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, you could just generate a new address per UTXO every time
you receive Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It’s much harder to do that in Ethereum and other account based
blockchains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turns out that basic analysis renders this
technique of regenerating pseudonyms ineffective.</p>

<p>Similar to a lock on a front door, generating new pseudonyms for
every transaction does keep away naive attackers, but a determined
opponent can probably find a way to link your activity together.</p>

<p>The term “linking” in the context of anonymity is the act of
associating a real-world identity to a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Linking is also sometimes called deanonymization.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, advanced linking can associate a real-world identity to
an address.</p>
<p>And same goes in Ethereum, where a real-world identity could be
linked to an externally owned account.</p>
<p>And the list goes on…</p>
<p>Most of these blockchain technologies are fairly secure though for
the most part, since linking as we’ll see takes a nontrivial amount of
effort.</p>
<p>So as long as a user isn’t reckless with how they manage their online
identities, they can assume that most people aren’t going to try to
deanonymize them.</p>
<p>But see, that’s the catch.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%" />

<p>The underlying technology might be anonymous or pseudonymous, but we
still have to consider human factors.</p>
<p>People make mistakes – especially your every day normal person, who
isn’t going out of their way to do all they can to possibly ensure their
privacy.</p>

  title="Anonymity and Ethics: Levels of Anonymity"

  style="width:45%" />

<p>What we like to say is that anonymity is not absolute – not a clear yes or no.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s on a spectrum.</p>
<p>We refer to an entity’s degree – or level – of anonymity as the
difficulty of associating that entity’s pseudonym with their real-world
identity.</p>
<p>A high degree of anonymity allows one to reasonably expect having
achieved privacy.</p>
<p>But again, why do we care about having a higher degree of
anonymity?</p>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>To deal with the question again of how anonymous cryptocurrencies can
indeed be used for money laundering and online drug purchases: we can
consider the following points.</p>
<p>We could have a partial solution, where the interfaces between
cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies are highly regulated.</p>
<p>Recall the AML and KYC from the enterprise blockchain lecture.</p>
<p>For example, we might want to be able to trade cryptocurrencies
almost anonymously, but not be able to touch fiat currency without a
picture of your passport.</p>
<p>Also, it’s worth mentioning that it’s immensely hard – if not
impossible – to implement a sense of “morality” at a technological
level.</p>
<p>Moral and immoral use cases look identical from a technological
standpoint.</p>
<p>And more fundamentally, who gets to decide what’s moral and
immoral?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, one might want to also consider whether the
positive benefits of anonymity to society might outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>For example, consider Tor.</p>
<p>Tor was created by the U.S. government, but now is used by many to
make it difficult for government officials to monitor their web traffic
– though there are still some ways to deanonymize even this.</p>
<p>And some users of Tor might be drug dealers or operating black
markets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tor has enabled free speech, for example for
reporters in oppressive regimes.</p>
<p>We leave further contemplation for you to do yourself.</p>

  title="Deanonymization: A Slight Paradox"
  alt="Deanonymization: A Slight Paradox."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>To round out our brief introduction as to why we might want anonymity
in cryptocurrencies, we contrast our goals of anonymity, privacy, and
security with that of decentralization.</p>
<p>If we design our blockchain system to be decentralized, then what
that means is that more of your data is in the network, for people to
publicly access.</p>
<p>Like we saw earlier, decentralization implies everyone has equal
control of everything.</p>
<p>More people will see your pseudonym.</p>
<p>The more of your data that is on the network though, the more data
that’s available to possibly deanonymize you.</p>
<p>This seems to show a slight paradox, where security and anonymity and
privacy are harder and harder to ensure, if we really want to be
decentralized.</p>
<p>And once again, we can tie this back to the fundamental trilemma we
saw in earlier lectures.</p>

<h3>Intro: Deanonymization</h3>

<p>As anonymous as we think we are, there are tactics that can be used
to deanonymize us.</p>
<p>We repeatedly cite Bitcoin as “pseudonymous,” and the reason is
because user privacy is not black and white.</p>
<p>Like many other qualities, it is on a spectrum, and as we learned
from the last section, Bitcoin does not provide the anonymity that most
users assume they gain from using cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>What are the tactics used for making that link between virtual
identities and the real-world entity?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at various data science approaches for
observing information on the blockchain to gather patterns and draw
conclusions.</p>
<p>And in the following section, we’ll be taking our understanding of
deanonymization tactics to design resistances to enhance user
privacy.</p>

<h3>Deanonymization</h3>

  style="width:45%" />

<p>The big concern about decentralization that we look at in regards to
deanonymization is that now, we can go back in the blockchain’s history
to reveal information about a particular pseudonym.</p>

<p>One way we can achieve this – which we alluded to earlier – is by
transaction graph analysis, which is simply just inspecting the
transaction history in the blockchain to derive useful information.</p>
<p>Particularly, we can construct transaction graphs, like you can see
on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>On a transaction graph, each node is a pseudonym, and each edge is a
transaction conducted between pseudonyms.</p>
<p>From a transaction graph, you might be able to see some pseudonyms
make transactions more than others, or are paid more than others, or
perhaps make certain transactions with certain other pseudonyms.</p>

  title="Deanonymization: Transaction Graph Analysis #3"
  alt="Deanonymization: Transaction Graph Analysis #3."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One way of analyzing the transaction graph is by clustering, or
attributing a cluster of addresses or pseudonyms to the same real-world
entity.</p>
<p>Taking what we know so far, we can identify two main heuristics in
associating addresses together.</p>
<p>The first is the merging of transaction outputs, and that occurs when
there are multiple inputs to a transaction.</p>
<p>For example, consider Bob, who wants to buy a coffee that costs 0.05
BTC, and has two outputs, one with 0.02 BTC and the other with 0.03
BTC.</p>
<p>He merges the two outputs into one that’s 0.05 BTC, enough to pay for
his coffee.</p>
<p>This is a fairly reasonable heuristic because it’s often the case
that outputs are merged by the same entity.</p>
<p>Rarely do people conduct joint payments.</p>
<p>Another heuristic is that of change addresses.</p>
<p>Say Bob wants to buy the same 0.05 BTC coffee the next day, but only
has an output worth 1 whole BTC.</p>
<p>Bob would send 0.05 BTC to the coffee shop, and the rest of the 0.95
BTC to himself at a change address.</p>
<p>This is fairly reasonable because in looking at Bob’s transaction
history, one of his two outputs must have been to a change address,
unless he had purchased two items at the same time.</p>
<p>And also, we could also look at whether addresses have been
associated with any previous transactions.</p>
<p>As per best practice, change addresses are usually newly generated,
so when Bob makes the transaction to buy coffee, he would be sending his
change back to an address never before seen on the blockchain –
something that we can easily identify.</p>
<p>In both cases, of merging transaction outputs or of change addresses,
if we know that Bob owns one address, we can guess with high confidence
that Bob owns the other associated address.</p>
<p>We use these two heuristics to link all these addresses to one single
person.</p>
<p>Through this way, we could identify clusters.</p>
<p>We talked about heuristics.</p>
<p>Now we’ll go over several techniques for identifying which cluster is
who – linking clusters with their real-world identities.</p>
<p>Businesses – at least those that accept cryptocurrency payments – are
outwards facing and consumer centric, making it easy to go to an online
service (such as Coinbase) and make a transaction with them.</p>
<p>Since we know our own public addresses, we could simply wait for the
transaction we made to show up within a cluster, or be merged into a
cluster, and that cluster would likely be that of the business.</p>
<p>This tactic is called tagging by transacting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s a much more passive approach.</p>
<p>We could just look at the graph and infer by looking at transaction
activity.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mt. Gox was a large part of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem,
and composed much of the entire transaction volume.</p>
<p>The graph to the right shows the Bitcoin transaction graph from 2013,
and the purple dot towards the right of the graph is Mt. Gox.</p>
<p>Similarly, SatoshiDice was a gambling site that allowed users to
gamble with small denominations of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This made for many transactions, though the total transaction volume
wasn’t nearly comparable to that of Mt. Gox.</p>
<p>The dot represented by SatoshiDice on the graph is very small.</p>
<p>However, there were a lot of transactions, so in the graph, it’s easy
to see that though the transaction volume is small, the transaction
frequency was quite high.</p>
<p>And this is true for any business or identity for which you can
leverage some pre-existing knowledge of.</p>
<p>If you have some leads on transaction volume or frequency or timing,
then you could look at transaction graphs and make solid linking
inferences.</p>
<p>As for identifying individuals, there are similar ways to deanonymize
them.</p>
<p>An easy way is to send them Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If you can manage to get them to reveal their address, it’s not that
difficult to track them from there.</p>
<p>This may require some social engineering if the other party is
suspicious or particularly cautious.</p>
<p>Another way is to watch online activity, particularly forums.</p>
<p>It’s possible that an individual might post their address on a forum
for convenience carelessly in order to get donations from general people
or even provide services.</p>
<p>Anyone who is watching, however, can now link that pseudonym with any
other activity.</p>
<p>Finally, several service providers, such as Coinalytics, offer
services to deanonymize funds obtained through illicit means, using data
analytics to discover your real identity.</p>
<p>Taint analysis is one way of easily tracing the movement of funds
through the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Taint analysis allows one to tag a “bad” address and trace its
associated activity.</p>
<p>It was this type of strategy that ruined Ross Ulbricht’s defense by
demonstrating that a majority of his funds originated from suspicious
origins.</p>
<p>As seen in the diagram, each of the red circles at the top represents
an address with 100% taint, meaning that it has either been denoted as a
dirty address or has received all its funds from dirty addresses.</p>
<p>Any other address in the Bitcoin space will have a certain amount of
taint depending on what proportion of its funds came from a dirty
address.</p>
<p>One might think that they can circumvent getting caught by sending
their tokens to a bunch of random addresses.</p>
<p>However, by design of taint analysis, that won’t work at all.</p>

<h3>Intro: Anonymity Through Mixing</h3>

<p>One of the biggest issues with anonymity in public and traceable
blockchains such as Bitcoin is that they are not anonymous at all in
their design.</p>
<p>We saw example of their weak user privacy in the deanonymization
section.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll see how we can combat deanonymization
techniques to enhance user privacy and achieve anonymity through a
strategy known as mixing.</p>

<h3>Mixing Basics</h3>

<p>First, a couple disclaimers need to be made.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we are not recommending nor condoning any of
these activities.</p>
<p>Second, for large institutions in traditional financial systems, some
of these mixing practices may even be illegal.</p>
<p>This is simply an intellectual exercise to understand how it may be
possible to anonymize your funds to make it more difficult for someone
else to track your activity.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 248. mixing: money laundering basics (319) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image248.png?raw=true"
  title="Mixing: Money Laundering Basics"
  alt="Mixing: Money Laundering Basics."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>To better understand mixing’s mechanics, we’re going to examine a
traditional scenario where money’s origins are obfuscated: money
laundering.</p>
<p>The reason why money laundering serves as a good base is because
their goals are the same.</p>
<p>As discussed before when talking about regulations, money laundering
is the very illegal activity of moving large amounts of undetected money
between countries or between the underground and legitimate economy.</p>
<p>Traditional money laundering uses hundreds of fake “shell” companies,
called shells because they don’t do anything or own any assets.</p>
<p>However, they appear to in order to successfully serve as money
laundering devices for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The first step to money laundering is placement.</p>
<p>Over time, the “dirty” funds, or funds obtained through illicit
means, are placed into these shell companies.</p>
<p>The shell corporations write off the deposits as purchases,
investments, services provided, et cetera, in order to make the
appearance of legitimate money entering the business through legitimate
means.</p>
<p>The next step is Layering.</p>
<p>This is the step where shell companies further pass their money
through other shell companies in order to further complicate the
financial supply chain to hide the true origin of the money.</p>
<p>This step of the process is what mixing will simulate.</p>
<p>The final step of the process is Integration.</p>
<p>This refers to when the clean money is reintroduced into the
legitimate economy through the purchase of luxury goods, the end goal of
all this money laundering.</p>
<p>Mixing will attempt to simulate this process of money obfuscation by
sending coins through several complicated processes.</p>
<p>To better understand what it means to be anonymous in our context,
let’s formally define something known as an anonymity set.</p>
<p>This will be defined as the set of pseudonyms between which an entity
cannot be distinguished from their counterparts.</p>
<p>In other words, it is impossible to do anything better than guess
when trying to choose an address within an anonymity set to associate
with some given entity.</p>
<p>The goal of mixing, then, is to maximize this anonymity set with our
resources.</p>
<p>Let’s say that mixing when done correctly now makes your entity
indistinguishable within a set of N peers.</p>
<p>This means that the anonymity set’s size after one round is N. Done
again with another unique N peers for each address, the anonymity size
is now N squared after the second round.</p>
<p>It becomes N cubed after three rounds and so on.</p>
<p>However, we do have to keep real-world constraints in mind, such as
however many resources are available along with the implications of
mixing.</p>
<p>Matters such as plausible deniability and trustlessness of mixing
also come into play since mixing alone isn’t enough to absolve someone
of suspicion.</p>
<p>First off, trustlessness is desirable.</p>
<p>Clearly, given the nature of the blockchain space, we want to ensure
that there’s no counterparty risk.</p>
<p>If someone else participates in a coin mixing process, they shouldn’t
be able to deny our services.</p>
<p>Additionally, we want to avoid our funds from being stolen.</p>
<p>Second, we want to maintain plausible deniability.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t stand out from one’s transaction history or any other
data sources that you’re mixing.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, then your activities will fall under much more
scrutiny, even if you’ve done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>These are properties we’ll seek after building up some basic examples
of mixing.</p>
<p>To make clear, there’s a fundamental idea behind mixing: the larger
the anonymity set, the harder it is to link pseudonyms to real
identities.</p>
<p>There are several different types of mixers.</p>
<p>These include centralized mixers, altcoin exchanges, decentralized
mixing protocols, and privacy-focused altcoins.</p>
<p>We’ll take a look at mixers in that order.</p>
<p>The simplest kind of mixer, the easiest to design, is a centralized
one, particularly a protocol known as Third Party Protocol, or TPP.</p>
<p>By understanding a central solution first, we can then explore how
other protocols may build off of this main design.</p>
<p>With TPP, a centralized mixing service will have a set of UTXOs,
referred to here as a slush fund.</p>
<p>Whenever someone sends an input to this mixer, the mixing service
operator will choose a set of UTXOs to return back to a new address also
controlled by Alice.</p>
<p>At the end, Alice now has her “cleaned” funds minus the fee the
mixing service kept.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see some of the issues with this centralized
service.</p>
<p>One of these issues comes down to counterparty risk: in this case,
you have to trust the central service providing coin mixing services for
you.</p>
<p>There’s hardly anything stopping them beyond reputation from
withholding tokens from you.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have to trust that the mixer is not keeping logs on
your information.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the central party, in order to blackmail certain
users or for some other purpose, is keeping a list of users who provided
dirty inputs as well as the eventual cleaned funds they claimed.</p>
<p>Finally, a centralization risk exists as well.</p>
<p>Because of a single point of failure, which can be brought down by
hacking or by a government institution demanding the shutdown of the
service, it’s not guaranteed that the mixer will operate as
expected.</p>
<p>Additionally, a small note to make: if the only UTXOs being sent to
the centralized mixer are dirty coins, those dirty coins will end up
becoming the new outputs for later users.</p>
<p>Without enough clean coins being cycled into the slush fund, it could
cause the mixing to do little for cleaning your coins.</p>
<p>A couple examples of centralized mixing services include Mixcoin,
which came out of Princeton research, and Blindcoin, which came out of
UMD and UPenn.</p>
<p>This is an example of how theory meets practical applications.</p>
<p>The next category of mixing to examine is altcoin exchange
mixing.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a specific central service to perform the
exclusive act of centrally mixing your coins, one can use a series of
exchanges to bring money from Bitcoin to several other cryptocurrencies,
such as Ether and Zcash, before finally coming back to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In this case, the cost of mixing coins is not a central mixing fee,
but rather the exchange fees between each cryptocurrency used.</p>
<p>The benefits of this approach is that the attacker now has to trace
the transaction chain through several disparate blockchains and
exchanges rather than simply examining a single blockchain.</p>
<p>Additionally, this process provides better plausible deniability,
since the activity looks like normal currency exchanging.</p>
<p>However, you need to rely on exchanges not to reveal the links
between your inputs and the outputs you receive on the other end.</p>
<p>Additionally, there still remains counterparty risk: if the exchange
happens to get hacked or otherwise freezes services during your mixing
process, you’ll lose whatever money you had in transit.</p>
<p>Finally, most exchanges in the US are required to keep personally
identifiable information and follow KYC/AML laws as mentioned before,
meaning that such activity may appear suspicious to exchanges,
especially if done repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Decentralized Mixing</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 249. decentralized mining: can this be done? (324) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image249.png?raw=true"
  title="Decentralized Mining: Can This be Done?"
  alt="Decentralized Mining: Can This be Done?"
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Thus far, our proposed solutions have leveraged either a single
centralized entity or several at a time. Is there a decentralized
solution that will allow us to remove counterparty risk and avoid
fees?</p>
<p>One idea is to create a network of peers outside the Bitcoin network
who can cooperate to make transactions which mix their coins without the
need for any trusted third party. How could we go about doing this?</p>
<p>Before we start diving deeper into the details of mixing protocols,
let’s take a step back to understand what we’re working with and how to
recognize a good decentralized mixing protocol.</p>
<p>First, let’s pinpoint exactly what a mix is: it’s a set of inputs and
outputs each of equal size. The goal of mixing is to hide the mapping
from each input to its respective output.</p>
<p>To define correctness of a mixing protocol, let’s place the following
intuitive requirements.</p>
<p>First, coins must not be lost, stolen, or double spent, naturally.
Second, the mixing must be truly random and must eventually succeed in
mixing. If unsuccessful, the coins should be sent back to the honest
users, making the protocol resistant to DoS attacks.</p>
<p>To better understand the threats the protocol is up against, let’s
clearly categorize the possible types of adversarial models we’re facing
as well. These adversarial models pop up all the time when talking about
computer security.</p>
<p>The first type is a passive adversary. This actor is not part of the
mix and may seek to use surface-level information as accessible to any
other user to learn about the mapping.</p>
<p>In this scenario, ideally, basic anonymity will prevent passive
adversaries from connecting the inputs to outputs.</p>
<p>The second type is a semi-honest adversary. This type of adversary is
part of the mix.</p>
<p>Though they correctly follow the protocol, they may use information
gained during the process to attempt to deanonymize their peers.</p>
<p>Finally, the last kind is a malicious actor, also part of the mix. As
you might expect, they’re able to deviate from the protocol
specifications and may also attempt to steal funds from their peers in
the mix. They may send false messages or withhold messages entirely in
order to achieve some goal.</p>
<p>This may remind you of fail-stop faults versus byzantine faults. As
with distributed systems, this adversarial model system lies on a
spectrum. We’ll make another reference to some old concepts by
introducing the old concept of Sybil resistance.</p>
<p>Because decentralized mixing is another distributed protocol, it’s
also susceptible to Sybil attacks. Hence, we need to ensure Sybil
resistance, which has a two part definition in the context of
decentralized mixing.</p>
<p>First, there needs to be a resistance to stealing funds. This means
that we’re not able to rely on partial threshold cryptography, such as
m-of-n multisignature transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, we need to maintain a resistance to deanonymization. A
weak definition of this resistance is that participants outside the mix
are not able to determine the mapping of inputs to outputs, but
participants within still are. A strong definition of this is that even
participants within the mix are not able to determine the mapping of
inputs to outputs. However, we still need to acknowledge that a high
proportion of Sybil peers will greatly reduce the anonymity set, as
there are fewer unique entities within the mix.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few additional caveats to consider in the
context of mixing protocols.</p>
<p>First, there are side channel attacks. For this reason, we’d want to
user Tor for everything.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Tor is a protocol developed by the US government
to anonymize your internet activity by restricting the knowledge of
traffic to first-hop routers. Assuming that the Tor exit nodes you’re
using aren’t adversary controlled, this will allow you to securely send
messages to peers without detection.</p>
<p>Second, we want to make sure that it’s not obvious given the
transaction amounts which input corresponds to which output. Else, our
scheme would be trivially breakable. The solution is to use uniform
transaction amounts across the board to ensure all inputs resemble each
other, and all outputs are indistinguishable from each other.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to ensure that transaction propagation does not
unintentionally reveal our identities. This is known as network-level
deanonymization. The first node to inform the network of a transaction
is likely the source of it in almost all instances. Hence, we need a way
to get around this problem as well.</p>
<p>The first popularized decentralized mixing scheme was known as
CoinJoin back in 2011.</p>
<p>In this, coins are mixed together in what’s known as an n-of-n
multisig transaction. Each entity is required to sign off on the
transaction input for the transaction to go through.</p>
<p>One of the big benefits here that we achieve over other protocols is
that it’s trustless: funds cannot be stolen, since all users are signing
off on the CoinJoin transaction. However, it does come with quite a few
cons.</p>
<p>First, anonymity is not secure against even a passive adversary, such
as a mix facilitator.</p>
<p>Since the best way to implement this protocol is through a
centralized server, it assumes that private and anonymous communication
exists for submitting output addresses. This makes it vulnerable to
traffic analysis, where attackers can record and analyze network
traffic.</p>
<p>Additionally, participating in this mixing procedure is not plausibly
deniable. It’s very easy to spot on the blockchain since it’s an n-of-n
multisig transaction, which is unusually large. Though this can be fixed
with Schnorr signatures, which combine several signatures into one piece
of data, this currently does not exist on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not DoS resistant. Since it requires an n-of-n
transaction sign-off, even one node disconnecting or intentionally
disrupting the process can cause the entire mix to fail.</p>
<p>Your next question hopefully is, “Can we do better?” Thankfully, the
answer is yes.</p>
<p>CoinShuffle is the sequel to CoinJoin, using a decryption mixnet to
jointly compute the input/output shuffling, where a mixnet is a routing
protocol using cryptography to obfuscate the information trail.</p>
<p>One of the benefits to this protocol is that it uses an “Accountable
Anonymous Group Messaging” protocol known as Dissent to resolve any
traffic analysis issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, it achieves anonymity against the mix facilitator
because communications are now decentralized.</p>
<p>Finally, with this decryption mixnet, it provides strong Sybil
resistance against deanonymization.</p>
<p>However, it still suffers from the drawbacks of CoinJoin. Though
Sybil resistance is stronger, it is not absolute. It’s still possible to
deanonymize someone via a Sybil attack.</p>
<p>Additionally, like CoinJoin, CoinShuffle is vulnerable to DoS attacks
as well.</p>
<p>A drawback new to CoinShuffle is the ability of the last peer in the
decryption mixnet to determine the outcome of the input/output
shuffling, possibly giving this person the ability to manipulate the
ordering in their favor.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the significance of CoinShuffle’s
decryption mixnet, let’s dive into an overview. The purpose of the
mixnet is to prevent anyone from knowing which message was sent by which
individual except for the individuals themselves.</p>
<p>The first step in this process is to encrypt the messages, in our
case the output addresses of the transaction, with the public keys of
each of the participating peers.</p>
<p>From here, each of the messages has been decrypted in the same order.
Say Red is the first to unravel a layer of decryption from each of the
messages. Red, after decrypting the layer of encryption generated via
Red’s own public key, will randomly scramble the message order.</p>
<p>Red cannot tell which input positions will correspond to which final
output positions, and no one knows what Red did with the messages
assuming Red does not disclose that information.</p>
<p>Red will then pass it onto Blue, and so on, until all the layers are
peeled off.</p>
<p>The issue with this protocol is that the final decision for ordering
the output addresses with full knowledge of the final result lies with
whichever peer is at the end of the process, allowing them to determine
the final shuffle permutation.</p>
<p>As mentioned briefly earlier, there is a liquidity problem with each
of these solutions: they all are likely only to be used by others with
dirty coins. What’s the point in mixing coins if all you get back are
dirty coins?</p>
<p>Well, why not provide clean coins for mixing for a small fee? Due to
the small risk, these market makers can charge a small fee for their
services.</p>
<p>However, there are still some issues. One is that the anonymity set
is fairly small if using known liquidity providers. Another is that,
according to a research paper published in June 2016, an attack with a
recoverable investment of only $32,000 USD (at the time) would succeed
with 90% likelihood to deanonymize the entire system.</p>
<p>Another pending issue is that of plausible deniability. Currently,
it’s difficult to justify mixing without giving away that you may be
concerned about hiding suspicious behavior as one of your motives. Is
there a way to make transactions in a mixing protocol look the same as
normal Bitcoin transactions to passive observers?</p>
<p>Coinparty is a protocol designed to do exactly that, at the cost of
some protocol security.</p>
<p>The CoinParty protocol has three stages: commitment, shuffling, and
the final transaction. During the commitment step, peers will generate
an escrow address each. These escrow addresses require ⅔ consensus in
order to spend. During the shuffling step, the peers perform a secure
multi-party shuffle to scramble the output address ordering. Finally,
during the transaction step, the peers will agree to transfer out of the
escrow addresses to their designated outputs.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of the steps.</p>
<p>For the commitment scheme, how do we generate the escrow addresses?
Each mixing peer uses what’s known as Pseudorandom Secret Sharing, in
which each peer obtains a portion of the private key. Via this portion
of the private key, each peer can construct their portion of the public
key. Then, by combining their portions of the public key with their
peers, they can broadcast their shares to jointly reconstruct the escrow
address. This process is then repeated for every peer to generate an
escrow address.</p>
<p>The rest of the steps are relatively straightforward. Address
shuffling is similar to CoinJoin and CoinShuffle, through secure
multiparty computation. The transaction is signed using threshold
signatures via the previously generated secrets. Finally, if anyone was
detected trying to cheat the protocol, they can be punished.</p>
<p>The main benefit of CoinParty is high plausible deniability, since
CoinParty transactions on the blockchain look just like “normal” Bitcoin
transactions. Additionally, CoinParty has a larger anonymity set, as a
large number of normal Bitcoin transactions with the same amount is
orders of magnitudes more anonymous. Additionally, the protocol has
decent efficiency – it requires 2 transactions on the blockchain per
input peer, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>Some drawbacks however include reduced protocol security. By
introducing threshold signatures, the escrow funds are now entirely
controlled by these threshold signatures. This makes the protocol
vulnerable to a sybil attack: a malicious peer spawning several fake
peers can join a mix group pretending to be friendly, achieve over ⅔ of
the threshold, and steal all the escrow funds.</p>
<p>To conclude, let’s compare the overarching benefits and costs.</p>
<p>Some benefits include not having a central point of failure, such as
with CoinShuffle, and maintaining anonymity against a mix facilitator.
However, the drawbacks across all include deanonymization via Sybil
attacks, facing a tradeoff between centralized servers such as in
CoinJoin and anonymity such as in CoinShuffle, and the tradeoff between
plausible deniability and security.</p>

<h3>Fair Exchange Mixers</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 250. fair exchange mixers - blockchain fundamentsls (331) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image250.png?raw=true"
  title="Fair Exchange Mixers: Blockchain Fundamentals"
  alt="Fair Exchange Mixers: Blockchain Fundamentals."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Fair exchange mixers are a different category of mixer.</p>
<p>They build upon the traditional fair exchange protocol to no longer
require a trusted third party to participate as part of the
protocol.</p>
<p>Instead, some party A pays another party B through an untrusted
intermediary T.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two parties, Alice and Bob, who wish to trade
(cryptographic) “items” somehow.</p>
<p>However, you run into a problem: suppose Alice sends her item to Bob,
but Bob then refuses to send his item to Alice.</p>
<p>In that case, it is not a fair exchange: Bob got Alice’s item, but
Alice got nothing in return, the poor thing.</p>
<p>Fair exchange protocols seek to ensure that scenario never
happens—either they both get each other’s “item” or they both get
nothing.</p>
<p>If the “item” being exchanged fits certain criteria, then fair
exchange protocols can be improved upon to have other nice properties,
like no longer requiring a trusted third party or being able to detect a
dishonest third party.</p>
<p>In this scenario, what’s being traded is coins for a voucher.</p>
<p>Alice can deposit her coins and receive a voucher to redeem a
comparable amount of coin later.</p>
<p>She can then redeem clean coins at her discretion, cleaning her
assets.</p>
<p>However, this style of mixer assumes that enough transactions are
passing through the mixer at the same time such that distinguishing
which inputs match to which outputs is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>CoinSwap uses hash-locked 2-of-2 multisignature transactions to do
exactly this.</p>
<p>It allows you to securely swap your coins with someone else without
linking your transactions.</p>
<p>The benefits are that it’s trustless, since no party can steal your
funds, and has decent plausible deniability.</p>
<p>However, it also comes with the drawback that it’s not secure against
a mix-passive intermediary.</p>
<p>Though, this intermediary can also be the person you’re swapping
with.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s expensive, as it requires 4 transactions per
swap.</p>
<p>The way it looks on the blockchain is like Alice is paying some
address, and Bob is paying some other address, but there is no direct
connection between the original coins and the new ones.</p>
<p>XIM, a protocol similar to CoinSwap, also uses an untrusted
intermediary to create a fair-exchange mixer.</p>
<p>This builds on earlier work on fair exchange and uses fees to prevent
DoS and Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>XIM creates a secure group-forming protocol for finding parties to
participate in a mix.</p>
<p>The issue with XIM is that it takes several hours to run because of
the group-forming protocol.</p>
<p>Blindly Signed Contracts build further off XIM to prevent the group
forming process, instead using anonymous fee vouchers to deter DoS and
Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>The issue is that implementing BSC would require scripting
functionality not currently provided by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The idea behind TumbleBit specifically is to improve on BSC so that
the mixer is in fact Bitcoin-compatible.</p>
<p>This makes it state of the art in fair-exchange mixers as of
2016.</p>
<p>It implements an “RSA evaluation as a service” protocol to make
Blindly Signed Contracts Bitcoin-compatible.</p>
<p>It is fairly feasible for real-world use, given that enough liquidity
exists to power the process.</p>
<p>The general benefits with fair exchange mixers is they’re trustless,
placing no trust in an intermediary.</p>
<p>Additionally, some are even DoS and Sybil attack resistant.</p>
<p>The drawbacks, however, are that they’re difficult to build.</p>
<p>TumbleBit only works with sufficient liquidity, XIM requires a few
hours of computation, and BSC requires advances to Bitcoin Script.</p>

<h3>Intro: Anonymity Through Altcoins</h3>

<p>Mixing is something that a user would consciously have to do.</p>
<p>Every time a user wants to be anonymous, they’d have to go out of
their way mix them.</p>
<p>What if the platform itself automatically anonymized or mixed coins
to preserve privacy by default?</p>
<p>This way, privacy is but a one time choice for the user, and there is
no suspicion on any individual user in the platform since anonymity is
integrated into the protocol.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll cover some privacy focused altcoins and the
technologies they are built upon to protect their users.</p>

<h3>Privacy Focused Altcoins</h3>

  alt="CoinJoin Dash: Privacy Focused AltCoins"
  style="width:45%" />

<p>DASH, formerly known as DarkCoin, is a privacy focused cryptocurrency
that uses a mixer called</p>
<p>CoinJoin, which we talked about in the previous section.</p>
<p>In Dash, in addition to traditional Proof-of-Work rewards, there’s a
secondary network layer of what are known as masternodes.</p>
<p>Users who run master nodes are tasked with performing privileged
actions such as voting on proposals for network governance, instantly
confirming transactions, and mixing coins.</p>
<p>The idea here is that we have better plausible deniability because
everyone is forced to go through CoinJoin for mixing.</p>
<p>This makes for a much larger anonymity set.</p>
<p>The way it works is as follows:</p>
<p>By default, on most dash clients, users have mixing enabled.</p>
<p>Dash calls this PrivateSend, but it’s essentially the processes of
executing CoinJoin, plus some Dash platform specific formalities.</p>
<p>When a user has PrivateSend enabled, meaning that they want to
obscure the origins of their funds, their client will first prepare a
transaction.</p>
<p>The transaction inputs are broken down into standard denominations of
0.01 dash, 0.1 dash, 1 dash, and 10 dash.</p>
<p>Then, a request is made to the masternode network, indicating that
you’re trying to obscure the origin of your funds.</p>
<p>When other users send similar requests indicating that they too are
trying to make private transactions, a master node mixes all the
transaction inputs of all the users, and instructs all users to pay
their now-transformed inputs back to themselves.</p>
<p>Now, all users who participated in this round of mixing now has the
same amount of dash back in their possession, minus some transaction
fees.</p>
<p>In order to fully obscure their funds of course, users need to repeat
mixing with masternodes multiple times – usually between 2 to 8
rounds.</p>
<p>Users of Dash wallets have the whole mixing process happen in the
background without any intervention of the user themselves, so when it’s
time to make a transaction, their funds are already fully
anonymized.</p>
<p>After all, this whole process of mixing does take some time, so it
should be done in advance.</p>
<p>Since coins are mixed in set denominations, transactions using mixing
may need to spend from more transaction outputs than those that don’t
use mixing.</p>
<p>And spending from more transaction outputs at at time leads to larger
transaction sizes, so users would have to spend more on transaction fees
than usual.</p>
<p>Some pros about Dash are that firstly, it solves the main issue with
plausible deniability we saw earlier.</p>
<p>Everyone takes part in the CoinJoin mixing process.</p>
<p>Since Dash uses decentralized mixing with CoinJoin, it’s trustless on
that end.</p>
<p>However, there is the main con though, that users have to trust both
the main Dash network and also its network of masternodes.</p>
<p>In order to become a masternode initially, users post 1000 Dash
bond.</p>
<p>And after that, masternodes also earn interest and standard income
through a proportion of the block reward.</p>
<p>If there’s an entity with enough capital, they could purchase enough
masternodes to subvert the Dash masternode network and potentially
deanonymize the network.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other altcoins, especially earlier privacy focused
altcoins, that were forks of Bitcoin, Monero was a fork of another
privacy focused altcoin called Bytecoin – which in turn was based off of
CryptoNote anonymous technology.</p>
<p>Monero provides guarantees on transaction untraceability and
unlinkability – guarantees on sending and receiving monero.</p>
<p>Untraceability means that for each incoming transaction, all possible
senders are equiprobable – thereby hiding the identity of the
sender.</p>
<p>Unlinkability means that for any two outgoing transactions, it is
impossible to prove that they went to the same person – thereby hiding
the identity of the receiver.</p>
<p>At a slightly deeper level, Monero’s functionality hinges on the use
of an advanced topic in cryptography, called ring signatures.</p>
<p>When a user wants to make a transaction in Monero, they choose some
set of previous transaction outputs to mix with.</p>
<p>These are then bound with the user’s transaction output they’re
spending from in a cryptographic ring signature.</p>
<p>In this context, ring signatures allow the user to prove that they
own one of the outputs without revealing exactly specifically which
output.</p>
<p>The anonymity set in Monero is the set of outputs you’re signing
from, and since mixing is enabled by default, like in Dash, Monero has
better plausible deniability than other non-privacy focused
altcoins.</p>
<p>The main distinction between a ring signature with an ordinary
digital signature is that with a ring signature, any verifier of the
signature cannot establish the exact identity of the signer.</p>
<p>In this diagram, say Alice constructs a transaction from herself to
another user, Romulus.</p>
<p>She constructs a ring signature with her public key, as well as that
of Bob and Carol.</p>
<p>Now, Romulus won’t know exactly from whom this transaction was sent –
only the fact that it could either be from Alice, Bob, or Carol.</p>
<p>And at the bottom here, the same situation.</p>
<p>Bob wants to send a transaction to Remus, so he makes a ring
signature with Dave’s public key.</p>
<p>So in these two scenarios, both Romulus and Remus have no idea where
these transactions originated from, and can only guess from their
respective anonymity sets – those whose identities were involved in
constructing their respective ring signatures.</p>
<p>As a quick aside, the reason why it’s called a ring signature is the
ring-like structure of the signature algorithm.</p>
<p>Each of the incoming arrows being data encrypted by various users’
public keys.</p>
<p>So while ring signatures give us the wonderful property of not being
able to figure out where transactions come from, it’s still possible to
see whom transactions are directed to.</p>
<p>And that in turn might be able to provide some insight into where
transactions are coming from in the first place.</p>
<p>We need the property of unlinkability, and that’s implemented in
Monero as well.</p>
<p>For each payment, Monero clients will automatically create a unique
one-time key, each derived from a user’s public key – and this ensures
unlinkability.</p>
<p>In the diagram here, two one-time addresses are paying to Bob’s
public address.</p>
<p>Now, when Bob wants to spend from this, he can redeem it using
another one-time address.</p>
<p>We could somewhat do this in Bitcoin, where the best practice is to
generate a new address for each transaction conducted.</p>
<p>However, users’ money would be all over the place and they would have
to keep track of each and every address generated, or have a way of
deterministically generating these addresses themselves – perhaps
through a hierarchical deterministic wallet.</p>
<p>What Monero does is similar in that one time addresses are generated
deterministically.</p>
<p>It also allows for easy retrieval since everything is linked with the
user’s public key.</p>
<p>For some conclusions, let’s look again at some pros and cons.</p>
<p>Few coins have formally proven the anonymity behind their
product.</p>
<p>Monero is one of the few, as is Zcash – which we’ll talk about in the
coming slides.</p>
<p>Transaction values are obscured with cryptography as well; though it
has been a bumpy road in the past, due to bugs in implementation of ring
signatures and other security vulnerabilities, but it seems like all is
well at the moment on that end.</p>
<p>Monero has some good scalability choices.</p>
<p>It has a fast block time and allows for variable block sizes, making
it flexible during high and low traffic times of network operation.</p>
<p>As for cons, due to all the cryptography that is performed to ensure
privacy, transaction sizes can be quite large.</p>
<p>For example, the size of the ring signatures is linear in the number
of public keys in your anonymity set.</p>
<p>However, works in the recent years have shown that it is possible to
achieve the same functionality with sublinear space.</p>
<p>Monero has a pretty decent anonymity set – the number of identities
involved in a ring signature – but we can do better.</p>
<p>Zcash is an altcoin where transactions reveal nothing about input and
output addresses and also the input and output values of transactions as
well – allowing for fully anonymous payments.</p>
<p>And the way it does this is by using zero-knowledge Succinct
Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge – zk-SNARKs for short.</p>
<p>We talked about this briefly in the last lecture on scalability, but
in a nutshell, zk-SNARKs are a way of proving that you know something
without revealing what you actually know.</p>
<p>One side note is that UC Berkeley’s own Professor Alessandro Chiesa
is co-founder of Zcash, and co-inventor of its underlying protocol,
ZeroCash.</p>
<p>Both of these technologies rely on zk-SNARKs as we mentioned before,
and Professor Chiesa is also the author of libsnark, the C++
implementation of zk-SNARKs.</p>
<p>We’ll go into this in more detail later, but what you can do with
zk-SNARKs implemented at the protocol layer is that you can first have a
normal publically viewable base coin, such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can then mint it into some black box coin, which you can then –
in total anonymity – make a series of transactions.</p>
<p>There’s no way to correlate or distinguish coins and values while in
this black box.</p>
<p>Then, to get your base coin back, there’s a procedure called
pour.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at this.</p>
<p>If you recall in Bitcoin, or any payment network, you need to prove
three things in order to conduct a valid transaction.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have to prove that the input you’re spending from hasn’t
previously been spent – or more generally, that you have sufficient
funds for the payment.</p>
<p>Secondly, you have to prove ownership of the coins you’re spending
from.</p>
<p>And thirdly, you have to prove that the sum of your transaction
inputs is equal to the sum of your transaction outputs.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, proof that coins haven’t been spent previously is
information obtained from the ledger itself, and requires no effort by
the transaction sender.</p>
<p>The sender proves ownership of the coins they want to send by
digitally signing the transaction using their private key.</p>
<p>To allow this signature to be publically verified, the sending
address must be disclosed.</p>
<p>The recipient address also has to be disclosed, in order for the
recipient to then be able to spend the coins that they have
received.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, it’s easy to see that the verification of transaction
inputs and outputs is trivial, since so much information is disclosed
and publicly available.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to prove the same three facts
– that inputs haven’t been spent, that coins are being spent by their
correct owners, and that the sum of inputs is equal to the sum of
transaction outputs.</p>
<p>And this is all done with zero knowledge – without revealing any
information about the sender, recipient, or the assets that are being
transferred.</p>
<p>Each valid transaction is sent with an accompanying zk-SNARK, which
prove the three facts we previously stated.</p>
<p>Transaction inputs are proofs of validity for the transaction, and
outputs are the details required to construct a zero knowledge proof,
encrypted of course with the recipient’s public key.</p>
<p>The information required to spend the transaction outputs is also
attached to the transaction – again encrypted – and details how to
construct a new zk-SNARK that enables spending.</p>
<p>Zcash has two layers, a transparent layer and a zero-knowledge
security layer.</p>
<p>And users transfer their assets between these two layers using the
mint and pour transactions, as we mentioned before.</p>
<p>The reason for having these two separate layers is because at its
core, the fundamental innovation of Zcash was its implementation of the
zero knowledge security layer; its transparent layer started simply as a
fork of the Bitcoin codebase.</p>
<p>Users are generally more likely to be comfortable with transparent
cryptocurrencies they’ve seen or used in the past – like Bitcoin – so if
users like that, then Zcash shouldn’t take that away.</p>
<p>Enabling Bitcoin-style transparent transactions also make it simple
to integrate with Zcash using existing tools and infrastructure that
were originally built to support Bitcoin.</p>
<p>A fun technical aside; zk-SNARKs are built on top of homomorphic
encryption functions.</p>
<p>They have the following properties:</p>
<p>The first two are pretty standard, and if you’ve been around since
our first course, or have experience in elementary cryptography, then
this should be very familiar.</p>
<p>Firstly, given an output, it’s hard to find the input.</p>
<p>Different inputs should lead to different outputs.</p>
<p>Where this starts to get interesting though, is that now, rather than
wanting homomorphic functions to be random, we want to be able to
perform operations on outputs of homomorphic functions.</p>
<p>For example, if we know the outputs of a homomorphic encryption
function on two different input values, we can find the output of the
function on some arithmetic combination of the two inputs – all without
knowing the input values themselves.</p>
<p>In other words, we want to allow computation on ciphertext,
generating an encrypted result which, when itself decrypted, matches the
result of the computations as if they had been performed on the
plaintext itself.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple way to grasp this idea of homomorphic encryption.</p>
<p>Say Alice has two numbers x and y such that x + y = 7.</p>
<p>Alice doesn’t want Bob to know x and y, but she wants to prove to Bob
that x + y = 7.</p>
<p>Alice sends F(x) and F(y) to Bob, where F is a homomorphic
function.</p>
<p>Bob can then find F(x+y) from F(x) and F(y), since F is
homomorphic.</p>
<p>Then, Bob can check if F(x+y) = F(7), verifying the fact that x + y
is indeed equal to 7.</p>
<p>And that’s at a very, very high level how some of the math works
behind Zcash.</p>
<p>Alice in this case doesn’t reveal the values x and y to Bob.</p>
<p>Those can be transaction inputs.</p>
<p>However, Bob can verify that those two values combined equals some
output value.</p>
<p>Some final thoughts on Zcash.</p>
<p>One pro is that Zcash is fully anonymous.</p>
<p>Assuming the underlying cryptography is secure, transactions
conducted in Zcash’s blackbox zero-knowledge security layer are fully
anonymous.</p>
<p>Their anonymity set is the entire blackbox history.</p>
<p>Another pro is that of modularity.</p>
<p>Zcash was originally implemented on top of a fork of Bitcoin for
convenience and also integration with existing tools.</p>
<p>However, it can also be integrated with any other consensus
mechanism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zcash is very resource intensive.</p>
<p>And that’s due to the fact that zk-SNARK proof systems in use require
about 4 GB of RAM and 40 seconds of computation on modern CPUs in order
to generate proofs for pour transactions.</p>
<p>Proofs require a semi-trusted one-time setup.</p>
<p>Adversaries with malicious setup parameters can mint coins without
spending base coins.</p>
<p>This can be somewhat mitigated with a secure multiparty computation
setup, but that’s out of scope for this course.</p>
<p>It is an interesting challenge in integrating such technologies into
blockchain though, so it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h3>
Intro: Advanced Anonymity &amp; Generalizations
</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve gone through all these anonymity techniques,
separating them category by category, you’re likely wondering what else
is left to discussion.</p>
<p>There are some novel anonymity tactics that don’t fall into the
mixing or altcoin tactics but are features of blockchain protocols
themselves.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll be covering more advanced anonymity techniques
that didn’t fit well into any previous category.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll bring back the contention between user experience and
privacy, and discuss more in depth the trilemma that all blockchains
face as a conclusion for the last three lectures.</p>

  title="Mimblewimble: Another  Pseudonymous Proposal"
  alt="Mimblewimble: Another  Pseudonymous Proposal."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In traditional cypherpunk fashion, there was a proposal published in
July of 2016.</p>
<p>It simply read: “hi, i have an idea for improving privacy in
bitcoin.</p>
<p>My friend who knows technology says this channel would have
interest…” followed by a txt file proposal.</p>
<p>The proposal was written by a user with the pseudonym Tom Elvis
Jedusor, Voldemort’s French name in the Harry Potter series.</p>
<p>The proposal was called Mimblewimble, which was also a Harry Potter
reference – specifically a curse that was used to keep people from
talking about a specific subject.</p>
<p>On the screen here, you can see the opening lines of the very
mysterious MimbleWimble proposal.</p>
<p>The MimbleWimble proposal posed a design for a blockchain-based
ledger system that used a cryptographic protocol more scalable and
private than that of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>By modifying transaction types in Bitcoin, Mimblewimble aims to be as
low-functionality as possible, while maintaining high-privacy and
high-scalability.</p>
<p>Because of this drastic change from normal Bitcoin, it aims to be
implemented as an alternate blockchain (a side chain or altcoin perhaps)
that supports a different type of transaction than what Bitcoin uses
currently.</p>
<p>On the privacy size, Mimblewimble builds upon Confidential
Transactions, an earlier proposal by Greg Maxell, by implementing range
proofs, homomorphic commitments, Pedersen commitments, and other
cryptographic primitives.</p>
<p>All values in a transaction are encrypted with so called “blinding
factors”, secondary elliptic curves used solely for privacy’s sake.</p>
<p>It bundles many transactions into larger transactions in order to
scramble inputs and outputs – to obfuscate the origin and destination of
Bitcoins – and also for scalability reasons as well.</p>
<p>With Mimblewimble, you can treat each block as one large
transaction.</p>
<p>And you can also merge transactions across blocks.</p>
<p>Joining transactions across blocks could extend all the way from the
genesis block to the latest block.</p>
<p>Mimblewimble can thus reduce the need to maintain entire blockchain
history since the genesis block.</p>
<p>The original proposal pointed out that to get to the current version
of the blockchain, one must start from the genesis block and start block
verification from there.</p>
<p>And as of July 2016, the time of publication, 150 million
transactions must be replayed to produce a set of only 4 million unspent
transaction outputs.</p>
<p>Mimblewimble promises to half the size of the blockchain: while still
maintaining confidential transactions and obscured transaction
graphs.</p>
<p>Mimblewimble simplifies the current Bitcoin model to transactions
that don’t need extra functionality other than simply transferring value
from sender to recipient.</p>
<p>It does this by eliminating Bitcoin script.</p>
<p>And that’s the price one must pay to enable such privacy that
Mimblewimble promises to provide.</p>
<p>Currently, Mimblewimble is under active development, and it’s most
popular implementation is called Grin.</p>
<p>Now, it’s important for us to reflect, to see how far we’ve come with
privacy and anonymity.</p>
<p>As an exercise in reflection, here are some recent quotes from
influential people in the whole space of crypto for privacy.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from Timothy May, the author of The Crypto Anarchist
Manifesto.</p>
<p>“I think Satoshi would barf. Or at least work on a replacement for
Bitcoin as he first described it in 2008 - 2009.”</p>
<p>That’s a pretty pessimistic outlook, but that’s from the perspective
of crypto anarchists.</p>
<p>And while that cause was the motivating factor for creating Bitcoin
in the first place, the average user probably doesn’t strongly align
that ideology.</p>
<p>Next, here’s a quote from Riccardo Spagni, the main maintainer of the
Monero project.</p>
<p>“Privacy isn’t a thing you achieve, it’s a constant cat-and-mouse
battle.”</p>
<p>This is true in that you just don’t simply achieve privacy – or it’s
not that likely that you can just achieve privacy.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it’s easy to see why.</p>
<p>With privacy, you could have the most secure system in the world, but
the moment one part fails, or it’s shown that a part of your system can
possibly be broken or exploited, then you’ve lost.</p>
<p>Nicolas Christin from Carnegie Mellon was part of a team that found a
major vulnerability in Monero early 2018, and he summarizes the previous
point pretty concisely in relation to immutable, public ledgers.</p>
<p>“You have a permanent record of everything taking place.</p>
<p>If, down the road, someone finds a vulnerability that you can reveal
what happened in the past, you may still be at risk.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that privacy is a major challenge.</p>
<p>But in general, it’s actually more of a matter of security than of
privacy.</p>
<p>Privacy can be seen as a subset of security; privacy is the act of
protecting confidential information, where security is the
protecting.</p>
<p>And tying back to security, we can again look at the scalability
trilemma from the past weeks.</p>
<p>By now, it should be very clear that there indeed are tradeoffs
between security, decentralization, and scalability – if it wasn’t clear
before.</p>
<p>Clearly, centralized mixers and master node mixer networks sacrifice
decentralization for privacy and security.</p>
<p>On the other hand, multi-layer blockchain protocols such as Dash’s
master node network and Zcash’s zero-knowledge security layer have
associated overhead that may hinder performance – not to mention other
protocol specific scalability hits.</p>
<p>Often times, in regards to mixing, it’s said that mixing should be
done in advance so as to spread out mixing overhead.</p>
<p>This unfortunately is not possible if a user is sending many small
transactions, where each incurs a non-negligible mixing fee.</p>
<p>And if they run out of pre-mixed funds, that incurs mixing
overhead.</p>
<p>Really, there is no perfect all around blockchain system.</p>
<p>Instead, each is designed for its specific goal and use case.</p>

<h3>Text: Week 5 Summary</h3>

<h3>I. Anonymity Basics</h3>

<p>It’s a common misconception that anonymity in cryptocurrencies is
only useful for buying drugs or participating in illegal activities. The
truth is, everyone benefits from anonymity. Anonymity helps in providing
crucial properties of currency. For
example, <strong>fungibility</strong> is the idea that every unit of a
currency must be equal in value to every other unit. Cash is fungible
because it is anonymous – a dollar is a dollar. It may also be dangerous
if information about a user’s identity/assets are made public.</p>
<p>Most blockchains are pseudonymous by default, not anonymous. With
their sights set on decentralization first and foremost, the original
designers of Bitcoin chose to build a distributed database in which
everyone (all full nodes) stores the Bitcoin blockchain. While this
grants us decentralization properties, the fact that records of all
transactions are now public is concerning, especially for those who do
not actively adhere to best practices, such as generating a new
pseudonym for each transaction. Additionally, the privacy of users can
be severely compromised if their virtual identities, or
their <strong>pseudonyms</strong>, are somehow linked to their real ones
– this is known as <strong>linking</strong>. </p>
<p>And sometimes, as hard as one might try to make a particular
technology secure, private, or anonymous, human factors make all of this
very difficult.</p>

<h3>
  <ol start="2" type="I">
    <li>Deanonymization</li>
  </ol>
</h3>

<p>The goal of deanonymization is to link your online identity
(pseudonym) to your real identity through analysis and heuristics. </p>
<p>One technique is <strong>Transaction Graph Analysis</strong>, the
process of constructing a <strong>transaction graph</strong> (pictured
below) where each node is a pseudonym and each edge is a transaction
conducted between pseudonyms.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="The transaction graph shows the crypto transactions in the network. 
    Satoshi, Mt Gox and silk road are nodes where most edges are connected to."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>This graph can be analyzed by <strong>clustering</strong>, or
attributing a group of pseudonyms to the same real-world entity. The
first part of clustering, actually creating the clusters, can be
performed using various heuristics, two of which are <strong>merging
transaction outputs</strong> and <strong>change addresses</strong>. In
regards to the second part, linking clusters with
their real-world identities, various tactics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tagging by transacting (useful for tracking businesses)</p></li>
<li><p>Relying on carelessness (useful for tracking
individuals)</p></li>
<li><p>Service providers, who use data analytics to discover real
identities</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Taint analysis</strong> can be used to tag “bad” addresses
and trace their associated activity throughout the network
(<strong>taint</strong> is the percentages of funds received by an
address that can be traced back to another address).</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>Anonymity Through Mixing
</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>An <strong>anonymity set</strong> is the set of pseudonyms between
which an entity cannot be distinguished from their counterparts. The
goal of <strong>mixing</strong> is to maximize the size of this
anonymity set, because a larger anonymity set means it is more difficult
to associate pseudonyms with real-world identities.</p>
<h3>
Centralized mixing solutions:
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Party Protocol (TPP):</strong> Of course, as with any
centralized service, TPP faces the issue of being a single point of
failure. Additionally, if the only UTXOs being sent to the centralized
mixer are dirty coins, the outputs for later users will only be dirty
coins unless there are enough clean coins being cycled through the slush
fund.</li>

  <li><strong>Altcoin exchange mixing</strong>, which works by sending dirty 
    funds through several layers of altcoin ⇔ altcoin exchanges to obfuscate 
	the money trail. This is less centralized than TPP. In this case, there 
	is no mixing fee, but rather the sum of the exchange fees between each 
	cryptocurrency used. Advantages of this technique include better plausible 
	deniability and increased tracing difficulty, while disadvantages include 
	the chance that exchanges may reveal the links between your inputs and outputs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decentralized mixing solutions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>CoinJoin</strong> was one of the earliest decentralized mixing 
    protocols proposed, all the way back in 2011. It used n-of-n multi-signature 
	transactions to mix coins together between n peers. The problems were that it 
	assumed there was some central “mix facilitator” with a central server 
	coordinating all the users, in addition to lacking plausible deniability 
	and DoS resistance.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>CoinShuffle</strong> improved upon CoinJoin by introducing 
    <strong>decentralized mixnets</strong>, which allow a set of users to 
	pool together inputs from a group without revealing which input was 
	submitted by which user. Additionally, it used an “Accountable Anonymous 
	Group Messaging” protocol known as Dissent to coordinate users. Though 
	this prevents attacks such as traffic analysis and deanonymization by a 
	mix facilitator, it is still susceptible to all the drawbacks associated 
	with CoinJoin.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>JoinMarket</strong> sought to fill a liquidity market of 
    mixable coins for a fee, allowing anyone to contact this service to 
	mix their coins. However, this approach does not provide a large anonymity 
	set and was claimed to be deanonymizable with $32,000 USD alone.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>CoinParty</strong> aimed to provide efficient mixing with 
    plausible deniability and a larger anonymity set via escrow addresses 
	and threshold signatures. However, this comes at the cost of some protocol 
	security, as any ⅔ of the users colluding can steal funds from all the 
	other users.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Fair exchange mixers:</h3>

<p>These are built upon the
traditional <strong>fair-exchange</strong> protocol so that no trusted
third party is needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>CoinSwap</strong> - uses hash-locked, 2-of-2 multi-signature 
    transactions to securely swap coins without linking transactions. While 
	this process is trustless and provides better plausible deniability, it 
	comes at the cost of inefficiency and is also insecure against mix-passive 
	intermediary.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>XIM</strong> - Uses untrusted intermediary to create fair-exchange mixer. 
    It prevents Sybil and DoS attacks by enforcing fees to use service, but it requires 
	several hours to run because of group-forming protocol.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>BSC</strong> - Builds upon XIM to allow users to skip group-forming 
    protocol with anonymous fee vouchers. However, it is not supported on the Bitcoin 
	protocol due to insufficient scripting capabilities.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>TumbleBit</strong> - implements an “RSA evaluation as a service” 
    protocol to make BSC possible on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4" type="I">
  <li><h3>Anonymity Through Altcoins</h3></li>
</ol>

<p>There exist altcoins with protocols where privacy is built in so that
there is no suspicion towards any individual user. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>DASH</strong> - employs a network of Masternodes to perform 
    privileged actions (voting on proposals, confirming transactions instantly, 
	and mixing the coins of all network participants)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Monero</strong> - provides guarantees on transaction untraceability and unlinkability</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><em>Untraceability</em>: for any incoming transaction, all possible 
	  senders are equiprobable</p></li>
    <li><p><em>Unlinkability</em>: for any two outgoing transactions, it is 
	  impossible to prove that they went to the same person</p></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Zcash</strong> - transactions reveal nothing about input and 
    output addresses, using <strong>zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive 
	ARguments of Knowledge</strong> (zk-SNARKs)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>V. Advanced Anonymity &amp; Generalizations</h3>

<p><strong>Mimblewimble</strong> proposes a more scalable and private
cryptographic protocol than that of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In regards to privacy, MimbleWimble supports <strong>Confidential
Transactions</strong> (proposed by George Maxell), where all values in a
transaction are encrypted with “blinding factors,” or secondary elliptic
curves for increased privacy. MimbleWimble also bundles multiple
transactions into larger transactions – this is done to scramble inputs
and outputs.</p>
<p>MimbleWimble is currently under active development and its most
popular implementation is called Grin.</p>
<p>MimbleWimble sacrifices some of Bitcoin’s advanced functionality
(namely Bitcoin script) for anonymity and scalability. As with all other
blockchain platforms, this brings us back to our trilemma – to enable
the increase in privacy, there have to be sacrifices with regards to
scalability and decentralization.</p>

<h1 id="ch6">A Blockchain Powered Future - Week 6</h1>

<p>We’ve made it 12 weeks into the Blockchain Fundamentals
curriculum.</p>
<p>Now, you are an expert in the history, design, and engineering of
cryptocurrency and blockchain protocols!</p>
<p>This week will focus on celebrating how far we’ve come and seeing
just how much knowledge we’ve accumulated, all the way back when you
first heard the definition of Proof-of-Work down to analyzing the
fundamental scalability trilemma and various techniques to solve core
problems affecting modern blockchain networks.</p>
<p>We’ll go over some frequently asked questions and throw in some fun
tidbits of our own about exciting developments in the blockchain space
and later see how we can apply our knowledge in more focused topics.</p>
<p>To end, we’ll see what the future of the world might look like if
blockchain technology garners widespread adoption, and how you can get
involved in making that future a reality.</p>

<h4>Announcements</h4>

<p>Welcome to the last week of CS198.2x Blockchain Technology, and of
the Blockchain Fundamentals program! </p>
<p>This week’s material is very light, and focuses on reflecting on how
far we have come so far, and also next steps. The program summary module
especially provides the overarching narrative of the Blockchain
Fundamentals program, skimming through all that we have learned
and highlighting the pedagogy and the sequence of lecture topics. </p>
<p>A quick reminder that your blockchain design final report submission
as well as peer and self-evaluations are due by course close. All
incomplete assignments from previous weeks are also due at the same
time. Please manage your time wisely. We are in the process of
processing everyone’s grades. Thank you in advance for your patience and
understanding.</p>

<h3>Intro: Program Summary</h3>

<p>We’ve made it so far in the curriculum; now would be a good time to
summarize all that we have learned.</p>
<p>In allowing the knowledge you have gained to marinate, we can review
the overarching narrative that reveals the true value of blockchain.</p>
<p>Rebasing our understanding with fundamental architecture of
blockchain and the problems it solves, we can then take away so much
more when we use what we’ve learned to solve new problems.</p>
<p>Although this is the 6th week of this specific course, hopefully you
have also taken the prerequisite course, Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In the total Blockchain Fundamentals curriculum, this is week 12, and
in this section we will review the culmination of all of our
learning.</p>

<p>You’ve done it!</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You’re finally gotten to the end of the course.</p>
<p>We’re going to show you an overview of all the previous topics we’ve
covered since the start of the first course, 198.1x: Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies, all the way until the final content lecture of the
second course, 198.2x: Blockchain Technology.</p>
<p>This will not only give you perspective into how far you’ve come in
your blockchain knowledge over the course of the last few weeks or
months, but it will also give you a glance into the overarching
structure of the program which you may not have noticed before.</p>
<p>Everything we’re going to go over is just a quick sweep through our
past material, so please don’t take this as a replacement for regular
lectures or as a content video.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s meant to give you the opportunity to get a little
nostalgic about everything you’ve learned thus far.</p>
<p>This first lecture, Bitcoin protocol and consensus, was the first
blockchain lecture you watched from our course.</p>
<p>It gave you a high-level overview of everything you needed to know in
order to understand Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We first talked about Bitcoin which was the first and most widely
used cryptocurrency and introduced you to some of the fundamental ideas
about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We then took you through the goal of Bitcoin which was to replace the
bank and show you how Bitcoin was able to do that as well.</p>
<p>We first introduced the idea of identity, how identity on the Bitcoin
blockchain is split into a public key and the private key where the
public key is what you use to identify yourself to others and the
private key is what you keep for yourself.</p>
<p>We showed how your public keys are secure even though you generated
them individually by making an analogy to a bunch of grains of sand each
with their own Earth with their own grains of sand, a very complex
analogy which hopefully you understood at some point.</p>
<p>We then looked at Bitcoin’s model for transactions, the UTXO model,
and showed how they, like piggy banks, that can only be used once.</p>
<p>We took you through some of these fascinating demos that demonstrated
exactly how the UTXO process works.</p>
<p>We explained why information has to be distributed between peers: in
order to prevent any one person from having control of the truth.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated what the blockchain structure looks like, and
why it was designed that way.</p>
<p>Finally, we learned consensus by iterating through various forms of
consensus until we reached proof of work, the form of consensus used by
Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It prevents any one person from voting more than once by tying their
voting power to some scarce resource, in this case computational
power.</p>
<p>After breaking down how Bitcoin works, we dived into the history of
Bitcoin and blockchain.</p>
<p>We learned about cypherpunks, crypto-anarchists, and the fight for
privacy.</p>
<p>We examined some early attempts at making a cryptocurrency, such as
DigiCash, HashCash, and B-MONEY, before finally arriving at Satoshi
Nakamoto and his invention, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We saw when Bitcoin was first ever used to purchase a tangible asset
back in 2010.</p>
<p>Fun fact, ten thousand bitcoins are no longer worth 81 million
dollars due to the recent drop in price.</p>
<p>We saw when Mt. Gox, one of the most popular exchanges, was affected
by a massive hack,</p>
<p>When Ross Ulbricht was arrested for running the Silk Road,</p>
<p>And when Bitcoin inspired hundreds, if not thousands, of other
cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>Leading to hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs around the
world.</p>
<p>One of the most significant cryptocurrencies which spun out of the
Bitcoin hype was Ethereum, aiming to provide a Turing-complete protocol
upon which smart contracts and decentralized applications could be
run.</p>
<p>We also saw when the space was shaken during the attack on The DAO,
which led to the infamous Ethereum hard fork.</p>
<p>We examined the regulatory, economic, and miscellaneous factors which
might cause investors to flock towards cryptocurrencies, and also what
might cause them to leave.</p>
<p>We watched as the hype train grew,</p>
<p>Visibility increased,</p>
<p>And the blockchain space had now bled into everyday
conversations.</p>
<p>But of course, what goes up must come down.</p>
<p>With pushback from governments, many of the average investors also
started to back out.</p>
<p>We then took a look at how the enterprise world viewed Bitcoin and
blockchain.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon first said that it’s a terrible store of value and that
it could be replicated over and over,</p>
<p>Only to concede later that year in 2014 that Bitcoin is in fact
competition.</p>
<p>He then said that no government would ever support Bitcoin because it
just doesn’t have any control, perhaps showing that he felt
threatened.</p>
<p>Three years later, in October 17, he then said that Bitcoin is a
fraud and said that if you’re too stupid to buy it, you’ll end up paying
the price for it.</p>
<p>But finally, in January 2018, he admitted that the blockchain is
real, distinguishing blockchain from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We started off with cryptoanarchy, cypherpunks, and the fight for
privacy,</p>
<p>Saw as the first forms of cryptocurrencies were invented,</p>
<p>And then finally saw large institutions like JPMorgan, the very thing
that Bitcoin tried to defy, were now adopting blockchain technology.</p>
<p>We also saw various places where the community for Bitcoin and
blockchain exists.</p>
<p>We took a look at some of the politics surrounding Bitcoin as well as
some of the controversial topics in the space today.</p>
<p>We gave a quick primer into ICOs, the hype, and why they’re so
popular today.</p>
<p>One of which being Cryptokitties.</p>
<p>We also took a look at some of the huge blunders that have occurred
recently, such as the Parity hack and the Coincheck hack.</p>
<p>Finally, after going through some context around Bitcoin and
blockchain, we went into the details of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin Mechanics
and Optimizations lecture.</p>
<p>We taught you about cryptographic hash functions, and how they can
ensure trust in a trustless environment.</p>
<p>We then started to dissect the blockchain, taking a look at the
components of a block, and at the components of a block header.</p>
<p>We took a look at the Merkle Root, the summary of transactions,</p>
<p>Saw what happens if someone tampers with it,</p>
<p>And proved how we can show that a transaction is within a block
without looking at every single transaction in that block.</p>
<p>Next, we discuss the previous block hash,</p>
<p>Taking a look at how this makes the blockchain immutable and showing
what happens when anything in the blockhain is mutated.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at the nonce, the implementation of
Proof-of-Work.</p>
<p>We showed how mining is like throwing darts at a target while
blindfolded.</p>
<p>You don’t know whether your guess is correct or incorrect; all you
can do is try more guesses.</p>
<p>We examined digital signature schemes, which show how Alice and Bob
can share information and authenticate their messages without sharing
any of their secret information.</p>
<p>We showed you the connection between private keys, public keys, and
Bitcoin addresses.</p>
<p>We also showed you how to turn a public key into an address.</p>
<p>We took a deeper dive into Bitcoin scripts, and showed you how a
script can actually unlock your Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We also took a look at the various kinds of payments, one which is
Pay to Public Key Hash, and the other one which is Pay to Script
Hash.</p>
<p>We also took a closer look at timelocks, which allow you to specify a
time at which your bitcoins can be unlocked.</p>
<p>Finally, after going through all those technical details, we showed
you how these characteristics manifest in real life.</p>
<p>We went through the various types of users that someone could be in
the Bitcoin network, depending on their desires and the amount of
hardware they have.</p>
<p>We went over how you can store your identity using wallets, and the
various types of wallets that you have in order to store your
bitcoin.</p>
<p>We also gave some specific examples of wallets that you could
use.</p>
<p>We also discussed paid wallets, hardware wallets, and brain wallets,
all of which let you keep your private key offline.</p>
<p>We went over some pros and cons for the various types of wallets that
you could choose.</p>
<p>We showed you how to get bitcoins into your wallets.</p>
<p>Through bitcoin ATMS, exchanges, or decentralized exchanges, there
are many different ways to do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, we showed you what simple payment verification was.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated multisignature transactions.</p>
<p>We went through a demo of how Derrick, Rustie, and Gloria can all
come together to form a multisignature wallet, so that no one person has
control of all the funds.</p>
<p>These multisignature wallets could be used between peers, yourself,
or even with a company, so that even if one of your keys is lost, at
least the company can help you recover your funds.</p>
<p>We went over some best practices, such as never reusing your
pseudonyms.</p>
<p>But the problem comes when storing all of these keys.</p>
<p>One way is to use the JBOK, or Just a Bunch of Keys, style of
wallets.</p>
<p>However, this is expensive because you have to store every key
pair.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could hierarchical deterministic wallets, or
HD wallets, which are much better for storing large amounts of keys due
to its recursive structure.</p>
<p>We then went into an overview for mining, about the various steps
that a miner needs to do in order to make profit.</p>
<p>The first step being downloading the entire blockchain, then
verifying transactions, creating a block, finding a valid nonce,
broadcasting that block, and finally getting profit.</p>
<p>We went over why miners do things: for profit.</p>
<p>Lots of profit.</p>
<p>The equation breaks down to this: the block reward and transaction
fees making up the revenue, and the fixed costs and variable costs
making up the costs.</p>
<p>We took a look at the various kinds of hardware that are used by
miners in order to mine, starting off with CPUs, then GPUs, FPGAs, and
finally ASICs.</p>
<p>We took a look at some examples of mining in real life, from Chinese
ASIC mining farms to some examples of ASICs that you could buy
yourself.</p>
<p>We also examined the problem of decentralizing mining, because in
practice, the idea of “One CPU one vote” doesn’t seem to hold today.</p>
<p>We talked about the requirements of a puzzle to make it satisfactory
for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We took a look at ASIC resistance and at memory hard puzzles which
could possibly deter ASICs from being used to mine.</p>
<p>Specifically, we looked at Scrypt, a hash function used by Litecoin
and Dogecoin.</p>
<p>We took a look at the pseudocode to understand why it was so special
and also looked at some of the other mining algorithms, such as X11,
X13, or even a periodically switching mining puzzle.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion was that no matter what mining algorithm you
choose, there’s really no such thing as an ASIC resistant algorithm.</p>
<p>We also discussed some of the pros and cons of ASIC resistance, a
discussion which you took part of in our forum boards.</p>
<p>We also looked at redirecting the work that’s typically wasted in
Proof-of-Work on something known as Proof-of-Useful-Work.</p>
<p>However, we discovered that Proof-of-Useful-Work does not actually
work.</p>
<p>We took a look at the various ways in which changes are pushed
through the Bitcoin system.</p>
<p>We looked at Bitcoin Core, the team of developers in charge of the
main Bitcoin repo.</p>
<p>We took a look at hard forks and soft forks, and how these are used
in order to update the blockchain.</p>
<p>And finally, BIPs, used to make proposals within the community.</p>
<p>After looking at how Bitcoin manifests in real life, and all of the
details that made it happen, we then started to discuss How to Destroy
Bitcoin, all of the ways in which you could attack Bitcoin from a game
theory stance.</p>
<p>We then looked at pool hopping, a way to maximize your rewards at the
expense of the pool managers.</p>
<p>We also looked at pool cannibalization, a way to distribute your
mining power among all other pools in order to make more profit than you
would if you were mining honestly, and even went through some examples
that demonstrate how this is possible.</p>
<p>If we were to take this a step further and model pool cannibalization
as a game, we see that it actually ends up being the case that all pools
are incentivized to attack each other, even though they would have made
more profit if neither of them had attacked.</p>
<p>We also went through the double spending attack at a lower level,
examining exactly how Gloria could double spend on Rustie.</p>
<p>We went through the idea of confirmations which allows Rustie to be
more secure, but also showed the circumstances under which Rustie cannot
assume he’s safe.</p>
<p>This showed us at the blockchain level how 51% attacks allow someone
to control the entire truth of the blockchain.</p>
<p>We went through blacklisting, what happens if one person tries to
censor someone else, and how much hashpower they’d need in order to
successfully censor someone.</p>
<p>We looked at punitive forking, which is what works when you have more
than 51% of the network hashrate, but we also examined feather forking,
which is a way in order for someone with less than 51% of the hash power
to actually be able to censor someone by using the incentive structures
of mining to their own advantage.</p>
<p>We then took a look at selfish mining, a way for miners to hide their
blocks in order to get a head start on mining.</p>
<p>And we showed how selfish mining ends up making consensus more
difficult for everyone because whoever’s selfish mining is able to get
higher profits.</p>
<p>We looked at some of the various defenses of selfish mining, such as
tiebreaking and Publish or Perish.</p>
<p>But we saw that each of these defenses has their own caveats that
prevents it from working perfectly.</p>
<p>We then took a look at the Bitcoin network and how attacks can be
done by manipulating the topology or network latency in your favor.</p>
<p>One could spawn nodes in order to affect the topology of the network
even though their mining power is the same in order to attack the
network.</p>
<p>In addition, someone could have a lot of dummy nodes that are trying
to sense the movement of a block around the network.</p>
<p>And finally, after fully dissecting Bitcoin, we got into Ethereum and
smart contracts, learning how the special properties of Bitcoin were
used in order to make this new platform for smart contracts, defining
what a contract was and a smart contract was, and then finally comparing
Bitcoin with Ethereum.</p>
<p>We looked at the various types of accounts on Ethereum and examined
how these contracts are compiled down to the Ethereum Virtual Machine,
or EVM, code.</p>
<p>We saw that Ethereum replicated a distributed computer, where every
node executes the Ethereum smart contracts and then comes to consensus
on the new network state.</p>
<p>This is similar to how in Bitcoin, everyone was the bank, except in
this case, everyone stores the state of computation in Ethereum.</p>
<p>We also examined gas and fees in Ethereum, which prevent someone from
being able to send infinitely looping code to the network.</p>
<p>The gas is what fuels the contract execution and prevents Denial of
Service attacks.</p>
<p>Each transaction is then translating the block state, gas, memory,
and other inputs into a new block state and a new state of gas through
the EVM.</p>
<p>We then looked at some basic use cases of smart contracts, such as
smart assets, multisignature wallets, and Proof-of-Existence.</p>
<p>We compared with the centralized solutions that we know
traditionally.</p>
<p>We posed this important question at the very end of this lecture: why
is using a blockchain better than using a centralized database?</p>
<p>That concluded the first half of the program.</p>

  title="Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems & Consensus"
  alt="Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems & Consensus."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>In our second course CS198.2x we decided to take a huge step back to
look at some of the big problems in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>Having studied Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in CS198.1x, the previous
course, now we take a step back and look at the fundamentals issues.</p>
<p>And in the first lecture we talked about achieving trust without
trust and more particularly about distributed systems and consensus.</p>
<p>At its core, consensus is a social issue.</p>
<p>How do we reach a majority opinion?</p>
<p>Or how do we achieve a general agreement?</p>
<p>Consensus is trivial if I’m the only one agreeing with myself, but
the moment when I try to come to consensus with some other peers then it
gets a bit more tricky.</p>
<p>The formal study of distributed consensus started really with the
study of digital avionics when they decided to put computers in very
adversarial environments such as on an airplane.</p>
<p>And the formal study of distributed systems really started with the
famous author Leslie Lamport.</p>
<p>And today consensus can be found in jet planes, spacecraft,
distributed lock servers in a cloud compute environment, and also of
course the topic of this course blockchains.</p>
<p>At their core distributed systems can be seen as a collection of
nodes and messages.</p>
<p>And we can look at them on a graph where nodes are the actual nodes,
the computers – the processes themselves – and edges are the messages
that have been passed.</p>
<p>Some of the properties of distributed systems are that there are
concurrent components, there is no global clock, and most importantly,
there’s the potential failure of individual components.</p>
<p>The question is how to achieve a reliable system from unreliable
parts.</p>
<p>We looked at some of the categories of properties including safety
and liveness properties of distributed systems, and also defined
correctness in terms of validity agreement and termination.</p>
<p>We then looked at one of the more famous theorems in distributed
systems.</p>
<p>And that is the CAP theorem where you can only have two of the three:
consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.</p>
<p>We then ran through a quick demo proof of how we can only have two of
the three and also observed that the CAP theorem isn’t really a black or
white trade-off, but actually on a spectrum and especially in the case
of blockchains, the trade-off is generally more between C and P, and A
and P.</p>
<p>We then looked at one of the more famous papers in distributed
systems, which is the Byzantine generals’ problem in which we have
general surrounding a city separated geographically and they have to
agree on whether to attack or retreat.</p>
<p>They all have to agree on doing the same thing and they can only
communicate with each other through messengers – and the messengers can
get lost and also there may or may not be a traitor among them.</p>
<p>And it turns out to reach agreement there is no solution for greater
than one thirds traitors.</p>
<p>The Byzantine generals problem teaches us to classify faults in two
ways being fail stop faults in which nodes just simply crash and also
Byzantine faults nodes that can lie to each other or send corrupted
messages.</p>
<p>And the parallels between the Byzantine generals problem and that of
public blockchains are pretty apparent.</p>
<p>Then we looked at some of the more traditional consensus algorithms
where nodes explicitly vote.</p>
<p>One of the earliest was Paxos, which told the story of the Paxon
parliament, in which proposers, acceptors, and learners all tried to
agree on which decrees to pass.</p>
<p>And the parallels between the Paxon Parliament and distributed
systems are quite similar.</p>
<p>And there’s a pretty clear correspondence between the database
systems that we know and the Paxon Parliament.</p>
<p>Paxos is used in practice and many of these companies listed on
screen such as Google, WANdisco, IBM, … for distributed lock servers or
of the like.</p>
<p>And other distributed consensus algorithms of the same class include
Raft and PBFT.</p>
<p>We then looked at some of the newer classes of consensus mechanisms,
in which nodes consume resources.</p>
<p>And this is the class of consensus mechanism that proof-of-work falls
into, and also proof-of-stake, proof-of-activity, proof-of-burn,
proof-of-space, and proof-of-elapsed-time.</p>
<p>We then looked into more detail into proof of stake where instead of
miners like in proof-of-work, we have validators.</p>
<p>Then looked at some flavors of proof of steak algorithms including
chain-based proof-of-stake and Byzantine fault tolerant proof-of-stake,
and also some implementations.</p>
<p>We then looked at federated consensus in which we can form quorum
slices.</p>
<p>And the demo here is that if I’m trying to agree with my friends on
where to get lunch, I don’t have to trust anyone other than my immediate
close friends, and if anyone else tries to join, then we can use the
intersection of our friend groups to make sure that we all agree on
where to get lunch.</p>
<p>Following the lecture on consensus mechanisms we took a deep dive
into proof-of-stake and also the cryptoeconomics that secures it.</p>
<p>Breaking down cryptoeconomics there’s the cryptography side which
aims to secure the past and also the economics side which aims to secure
the future.</p>
<p>In terms of cryptography, we have cryptographic hash functions which
give us awesome properties in terms of the immutability of the
blockchain, and also give us digital signatures.</p>
<p>And for economics we have primitives such as tokens and
privileges.</p>
<p>We also looked at the carrot and stick model as well as the concept
of security margins, uncoordinated choice models, and normal form
games.</p>
<p>Then looking back at proof-of-stake we realized that there’s problems
such as nothing at stake, which can be solved using slashing.</p>
<p>There’s also the long-range attack and stake grinding.</p>
<p>In the next lecture we looked at enterprise blockchains.</p>
<p>In the past there was a rise in interest in private blockchains, or
permissioned ledgers.</p>
<p>These blockchains are not open and not trustless and lack the
incentive structures like in the previous lecture where we talked about
cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>In analyzing enterprise blockchains it was useful to step back and
classify blockchains in general.</p>
<p>Specifically, blockchains are databases at their core, and databases
we can see them as central databases and also distributed databases.</p>
<p>A subclass of distributed databases are distributed ledgers, and
distributed ledgers which specifically use the structure of blocks
chained together are called blockchains.</p>
<p>We then classified blockchains in terms of their access control.</p>
<p>Namely we have public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum and
permissioned ledgers such as consortium blockchains and private
blockchains.</p>
<p>We saw that there’s various tech companies that are involved in the
blockchain space and also some varying perspectives on the whole
blockchain movement.</p>
<p>We clarified some misconceptions and also some things to look for
when evaluating enterprise blockchain platforms.</p>
<p>We then introduced a very fundamental observation that we carry over
in the next three sections, and that is the scalability trilemma, in
which you can’t really have all three of security, decentralization, and
scalability: there are some implicit trade-offs that have to happen.</p>
<p>For enterprise blockchain platforms we looked at Ethereum,
Hyperledger, Corda, Chain, Ripple, Rootstock, Quorum, and Cosmos and
Tendermint.</p>
<p>We then did a quick survey of the use cases and industries in which
blockchains are currently being deployed: including auto and mobility,
big banks and financial institutions, travel and tourism, digital
identity, healthcare, insurance, the Internet of Things, supply chains,
real estate, and foreign aid.</p>
<p>And then after all those we looked at some enterprise blockchain use
case generalizations in which we saw that in many use cases blockchains
are viable but not really necessary.</p>
<p>We also looked at the term “efficiency” when applied to blockchain
and how it may be misleading.</p>
<p>In general, blockchains are good at solving coordination failures,
horizontal integration, and of course pure decentralization.</p>
<p>And it turns out there are advantages of centralized solutions.</p>
<p>The big question is: Why is using a blockchain better than using a
centralized database?</p>
<p>And that’s something for you to decide when you’re evaluating your
own use cases.</p>
<p>We then did a quick survey of the ICO scene, looked at some of the
drawbacks, some statistics, AML, KYC, and also some perspectives on
enterprise blockchains.</p>
<p>And these spanned states and global as well, and these perspectives
are both good and bad.</p>
<p>Having seen all these use cases for blockchain we then looked at the
next lecture which is called Cryptocurrencies for the Masses: Scaling
Blockchain.</p>
<p>And this lecture looked at the fundamental problem of scaling
blockchains.</p>
<p>Namely at the current problems that we’re facing today as well as
dreams of how we can scale these blockchains in order to power the use
cases that we looked at in the last lecture.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, scaling, we’re trying to increase the TPS so we can
either increase the volume of transactions or decrease block time.</p>
<p>And we also looked at the size of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchains may be scalable and that they’re super-fast and can
support lots of TPS but when it comes down to it, storing the blockchain
is also a very big problem as well.</p>
<p>We then looked back at the scalability trilemma, having covered the
decentralized portion on the bottom left in the previous lecture on
enterprise blockchains and how there’s varying categories of blockchains
based on their access controls, now we look at the bottom right section
of the triangle which is on scalability.</p>
<p>In terms of scaling techniques there’s the usual vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal scaling and also blockchain specifically, we
have layer 1 and layer 2 scaling and that refers to whether scaling
solutions belong on the blockchain or off the blockchain, off chain.</p>
<p>A naive solution might be to increase the size of blocks, thereby
increasing the throughput.</p>
<p>The problem here is that because the time to broadcast blocks stays
fixed, then we have some nasty side effects which include the blockchain
increasing in size too fast and also naturally occurring forks.</p>
<p>A way we could possibly fix this is perhaps using GHOST.</p>
<p>We then look to increase in the block size.</p>
<p>Some pros and cons of course, and also of decreasing transaction
size, in which some implementations might be Segregated Witness like in
Bitcoin, where we move the signatures from within transactions out to a
separate structure called a segregated witness and of course some pros
and cons.</p>
<p>We then looked at xk-SNARKs and how we could use recursive SNARKs
also for scalability.</p>
<p>All these previous scalability techniques were all on chain
scalability techniques, or layer 1 solutions, and the observation now is
that we’ve run out of variables to play with.</p>
<p>We looked at the size of blocks, size of transactions, and also block
creation rate, but that’s pretty much all we can do on chain.</p>
<p>We need to look at something else.</p>
<p>Let’s just not use the blockchain.</p>
<p>We looked back at the fundamental problem of Bitcoin transactions and
how long their delays are.</p>
<p>The idea of payment channels is to bypass the blockchain and instead
create a private payment channel where Alice and Bob can pay each other
off chain.</p>
<p>The way this would be implemented would be Alice and Bob would open a
private balance sheet on the blockchain – so that’s one transaction –
conduct as many transactions as they want off chain, and then settle the
final balance back onto the blockchain.</p>
<p>And then there’s the idea of the Lightning Network, creating a
network of payment channels.</p>
<p>In terms of scalability, Lightning network can help us achieve up to
tens of thousands of transactions per second, but there are
centralization concerns in terms of the Lightning network.</p>
<p>Sharding is a horizontal scaling solution that is traditionally used
in databases, and we can now use them on blockchains.</p>
<p>And the idea behind sharding blockchains is that now we have multiple
parallel blockchains.</p>
<p>Of course, with all this complexity there are concerns in terms of
the varying node categories and also single shard takeovers and
cross-shard communications.</p>
<p>There’s also the idea of side chains in which blockchains plug into
each other like hub-and-spoke.</p>
<p>There’s a particular side chain scalability solution called Plasma
and Blockchain at Berkeley’s FourthState Labs are implementing Plasma on
Cosmos and Cosmos allows us to scale diagonally looking at both the
speed that Tendermint allows us as well as the interoperability of
blockchains in the Cosmos network.</p>
<p>In summary we reconsidered the role of consensus mechanisms in
scalability and also categorized all of our scaling solutions that we
looked at.</p>
<p>Having looked at the problem of scalability, another big problem in
blockchain is that of privacy.</p>
<p>Firstly, we resolved the question of whether anonymity is really only
good for cryptocurrencies in terms of buying drugs.</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>We pose some hypothetical situations in which anonymity is necessary
for a properly functioning currency, as well as some security
concerns.</p>
<p>We looked at the fundamental architecture of public blockchains in
which everyone stores everything and saw that blockchains are mostly
pseudonymous.</p>
<p>All of our transactions are stored on the blockchain for everyone to
see and there are methods of linking, or deanonymization, in which
people can link your pseudonym to your actual real-world identity.</p>
<p>And even if a technology might be anonymous or pseudonymous, there
are some human factors that we have to consider.</p>
<p>We noticed a slight paradox when trying to achieve anonymity and
security on the blockchain, and saw that it all ties back to the
scalability trilemma in which we’re sacrificing some decentralization or
some scalability for the purpose of security.</p>
<p>We then looked at the process of linking where we can use a
transaction graph, some clustering, as well as some heuristics including
merging of transaction outputs and also the existence of change
addresses in order to identify organizations or individuals.</p>
<p>We then looked at some more advanced techniques such as taint
analysis.</p>
<p>We saw that one way to achieve anonymity was mixing.</p>
<p>We made some formal definitions of anonymity sets and the goals of
mixing, as well as some desirable properties such as being trustless and
plausibly deniable.</p>
<p>We sought to increase the size of our anonymity sets to make it
harder to link our pseudonyms to our real-world identities.</p>
<p>Some types of mixers include centralized mixers, altcoin exchange
mixing, decentralized mixing protocols, and privacy focus altcoins.</p>
<p>And we looked at all of those.</p>
<p>We also looked at decentralized mixing protocols including CoinJoin,
CoinShuffle, JoinMarket, and CoinParty.</p>
<p>We then looked at some privacy focused altcoins including</p>
<p>Dash with its masternode network, Monero which uses CryptoNote
technology for ring signatures to have untraceability and also
unlinkability through one-time addresses.</p>
<p>We also took a look at Zcash, which uses zk-SNARKs as well as a
zero-knowledge security layer.</p>
<p>There are also some advanced anonymity solutions, one of them being
MimbleWimble, which aim to simplify the Bitcoin protocol to make it much
more secure.</p>
<p>And in simplifying Bitcoin we see once again we’re making a
compromise in terms of the scalability trilemma.</p>
<p>And now we’ve made it all the way to the end this is the last lecture
in the blockchain fundamentals program in which we talk about a
blockchain powered future.</p>
<p><strong>Intro: People’s Pick &amp; FAQ</strong></p>
<p>Throughout our offerings of both courses in the Blockchain
Fundamentals program, we’ve received many questions about the material
we teach, as well as questions about specific topics and the cutting
edge of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll cover briefly some of the best questions that
were asked by students such as yourselves.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll cover some advanced topics that we didn’t have time to
cover in the regular course.</p>

<p>Throughout our offerings of both courses in the Blockchain
Fundamentals program, we’ve received many questions about mining bitcoin
in real life.</p>
<p>This section aims to share our experience doing so, and some do’s and
don’ts for the curious.</p>
<p>Here we have it: Real-life cryptocurrency mining!</p>
<p>Mining cryptocurrency at first may sound like printing money, or
money growing from digital trees, but there are some things that need to
be considered.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>First of all, one ought to choose profitable hardware; the older
stuff won’t cut it.</p>
<p>Out-of-date hardware will often consume more electricity than would
be profitable to mine with.</p>
<p>Second, mining software differs depending on the intent of the
miner.</p>
<p>Do they only want to mine one specific currency?</p>
<p>Or is he or she willing to switch to whatever is most profitable at a
given time?</p>
<p>Does the miner want to mine in a pool, or solo?</p>
<p>These are all software side decisions to be making.</p>
<p>Monitoring miners is another concern, especially for those just
starting out.</p>
<p>Uptime, temperature, and profitability need constant vigilance,
especially with changing markets and changing seasons.</p>
<p>If not careful, mining rigs can be fire hazards.</p>
<p>Conversion between fiat and crypto is another point to consider.</p>
<p>Whereas power bills will be paid in fiat, you will be earning your
payouts in some cryptocurrencies, and sometimes this may be tricky to
spend.</p>
<p>Please do your due diligence before deciding to both mine or invest
in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Optimizing hardware costs == The goal of the average cryptocurrency
miner is similar to that of a traditional business man: to minimize time
to break even, and maximize return on investment.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 259. optimizing hardware costs (379) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image259.png?raw=true"
  title="Optimizing Hardware Costs"
  alt="Optimizing Hardware Costs."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>One of the ways to do this is to optimize hardware costs on the
assets that maximize rewards; for mining, this consists of GPUs, PSUs,
and fans or cooling.</p>
<p>Graphics processing units, also referred to as graphics cards were
all the rage in cryptocurrency mining, especially prior to the release
of ASICs.</p>
<p>They hash at a rate significantly faster than CPUs and thus are
essential components in a mining rig.</p>
<p>Because hashing rate directly determines your mining payout, one
would want to spend the big bucks on the GPUs.</p>
<p>PSUs, power supply units are equally important, as they are needed to
power the mining rig.</p>
<p>Higher end PSUs are more efficient, and waste less power.</p>
<p>Whereas a bronze-rated PSU may waste up to 10% of power being
provided to your rig, a platinum-rated PSU may lose only around 1%;
because this directly affects your profitability, you definitely do not
want to pinch your purse here.</p>
<p>Fans and cooling are also a significant component of your rig.</p>
<p>Overheated components perform poorly, and pose as risks as fire
hazards.</p>
<p>Hence, it’s crucial to keep your cards cool.</p>

  alt="Optimizing Hardware Costs."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>The non-essentials of a mining rig are all the components that are
not keeping you safe, nor bringing in the money.</p>
<p>CPUs are largely inferior to GPUs in terms of hashing power for most
algorithms, with the notable exception being CryptoNight.</p>
<p>Thus, most miners would prefer to purchase a cheap CPU and use the
savings to purchase an additional GPU instead.</p>
<p>Memory is also a non-essential, generally lower end RAM will suffice;
just make sure it is compatible with your other hardware.</p>
<p>Disk falls into a similarly unimportant role, with less than 50GB of
hard disk being more than plenty for SPV or pool mining.</p>
<p>This should cost $30 or less.</p>
<p>Other external components and even a computer case are unnecessary
for a mining rig as well.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need to look pretty, it just needs to get you paid.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 261. software - nicehash, multipoolminer (381) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image261.png?raw=true"
  title="Sofware Options: Nicehash, MultiPoolMiner"
  alt="Sofware Options: Nicehash, MultiPoolMiner."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Now onto software ==== In terms of software for mining, some common
options are Nicehash and MultiPoolMiner.</p>
<p>Nicehash is the most beginner friendly, sporting a clean graphical
user interface, automatic switching to most profitable mining algorithm,
and conversion to dollar amounts for easy understanding of your
payouts.</p>
<p>They do, however, charge larger fees– taking a larger percentage of
your miner payouts as commission.</p>
<p>MultiPoolMiner is a less beginner friendly tool, which also allows
automatic switching to most profitable cryptocurrencies and their
corresponding algorithms.</p>
<p>They take less of a cut compared to Nicehash, but are a little less
friendly to operate.</p>
<p>Solo mining as a full node for a specific currency is also an
option.</p>
<p>We would not recommend for anyone new to the game.</p>
<p>Return on Investment == As we alluded to earlier, break even time is
generally a good metric to measuring successful cryptocurrency
mining.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 262. roi and break-even time (382) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image262.png?raw=true"
  title="ROI and Break-Even Time"
  alt="ROI and Break-Even Time."
  style="width:45%" />

<p>Ideally, every business endeavor wants to minimize the time until
break-even, and maximize the profit multiplier of their investment.</p>
<p>To do this in cryptocurrency mining, the two main factors are cost of
electricity, and cost of hardware.</p>
<p>Depending on one’s location, the cost of a kilowatt-hour ranges
drastically, a huge point of consideration for everyone thinking about
mining.</p>
<p>As an example: California’s cost per kilowatt-hour is more than
double that of Louisiana.</p>
<p>The formulas for time to break even, and return on investment are
provided below.</p>
<p>That does it for our intro to building a cryptocurrency miner.</p>
<p>This is by far the most frequently asked question.</p>
<p>Please feel free to continue engaging in the discussion board; if we
find another frequently asked question, we’ll make another FAQ video to
answer it.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p>Many frequently asked questions in our discussion board have been
about the mechanics and theory of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency
technologies. Such questions have been answered extensively in CS198.1x.
Course staff have been making FAQ videos; you can find a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZvgWu86XaWlQ22vnBbcHzxPFrmlE3en6">YouTube
playlist here <u>Opens in new window</u></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more recent FAQ for this course:</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is in a block?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Many students who have not taken CS198.1x have
been curious about the actual contents of a block, especially in
Bitcoin, following our discussion of SegWit and other scalability
solutions. In Bitcoin, a block contains: a block header, block size,
transactions, transaction counters, and a magic number. We studied the
block header extensively in lecture 3 of CS198.1x. It contains a version
number, previous block header hash, merkle root, timestamp, target
difficulty, and a nonce. These values are important for ensuring
tamper-evidence. As the goal of blockchain is to ensure certain
innovative properties of blockchain, many other blockchains have similar
structures.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is “hashing”?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In our courses, we’ve explained “hashing” to be
the process of solving proof-of-work partial preimage hash puzzles. It’s
best to think of hashing then as a lottery, in which the more you spend,
the more likely you are to win. Or perhaps like throwing darts
blindfolded – you can’t really aim your throws, so to increase your
chances of getting a near-bullseye, simply increase your throwing rate.
Related questions have been about effective hash rate, wasteful hashing,
and hash functions in general. Course material can be found in CS198.1x
weeks 5, 4, and 3 respectively. It may help to get a general overview of
why we need to expend computational resources in the first place. This
is the topic of proof-of-work consensus and of the more general class of
Nakamoto consensus (expanding on the lottery analogy), which we define
in CS198.2x week 1.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why so much focus on Bitcoin?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You may have realized this in our program summary
section, but the overarching narrative of both of our courses can be
seen as modeling the gradual maturing and general sentiment about
cryptocurrency and later blockchain technologies. This approach explains
the necessary context in the blockchain space, which influences design
choices. Our narrative starts with CS198.1x Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies, explaining cryptocurrencies as the first use case for
blockchain, and Bitcoin as the original inspiration. </p>
<p>Our aim was to explore both the technological and social aspects of
Bitcoin, and towards the end of the first course reveal that intuition
from Bitcoin’s design carries over to understanding other blockchains in
general. While the name of the first course is “Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies,” one of the primary motivations was to decouple the
ideas of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from that of blockchain. And with
something to refer back to such as a solid understanding of Bitcoin, it
makes analysis of blockchain systems in general much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can blockchain be used in _______ industry?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There are many factors to take into account when
answering this question. In this course, we have aimed to teach a
framework with which students can gauge for themselves whether or not
blockchain is useful for a given use case or industry. It mainly reduces
to the question: what fundamental properties and innovations of
blockchain specifically does the use case leverage? These are all design
considerations, and the entirety of our second course should be of use
to you. Course material related to blockchain use cases can be found in
CS198.1x week 6 and CS198.2x week 3.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is ______ blockchain platform any good?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Again, our goal is to stay nonpartisan here.
There will be invariably pros and cons and tradeoffs in the blockchain
platform in question. These are all design considerations, and hopefully
our course material – especially CS198.2x week 3 – has empowered you to
judge these parameters by yourself. </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Other. (How do I get my questions answered?)</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are actively supporting this course and
engaging with students in the discussion boards. There are a lot of
students in this course though, so the best way to get a question or
concern addressed is to first scan the discussion boards to see if
someone has asked something similar, upvoting the post if there is one,
posting if there is not, commenting, etc. As a rough analogy to what
we’ve learned throughout this course and last, the posts with the most
“work” (upvotes, comments, activity) will be more likely to be addressed
first.</p>
<p><strong>Intro: Thought Experiment</strong></p>
<p>Throughout our entire curriculum, we have focused on looking at
problems from a top-down approach.</p>
<p>For example, a common train of thought would be: What problems are we
trying to solve with blockchain?</p>
<p>What key properties of blockchain are we trying to leverage?</p>
<p>And if there are none, then why are we using a blockchain in the
first place?</p>
<p>However, we haven’t really explicitly gone through what would
possibly be a blockchain powered future, in which everything is
integrated with blockchain.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll have a fun little thought experiment about the
future, powered by blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Would we want this?</p>
<p>And what design steps would we take to bring this about, or to burn
it with fire?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the extremes of our pursuit of blockchain; at one end,
a blockchain utopia, and at the other, a blockchain dystopia.</p>

<h3>Blockchain Thought Experiment</h3>

<p>We’re now diving into the two possible extremes of blockchain: the
first being a blockchain utopia, and the second being a dystopia.</p>
<p>This is just an imaginative venture for fun, so please don’t take it
too seriously or concern yourself with details.</p>
Let’s start with the utopia.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 263. utopian blockchain world: #1 (386) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>You leave the apartment where you spent the night, and as you leave,
sensors detect your departure and Slock.it’s smart contract pays back
your security deposit.</p>
<p>You order a coffee on your smartphone and as you pull up your
payment, a notification pops up.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder to extend your payment channel with the global
lightning network.</p>
Since it’s all secure and doesn’t cost you any money anyway, you decide
to extend your payment channel for another 20 years.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>You call ‘your’ car, but it’s not really yours; it’s plugged into an
autonomous ad hoc swarm of electric vehicles readily available for
use.</p>
<p>The cars have no owner and instead run entirely on smart
contracts.</p>
<p>Using their collective income, they pay for recharging themselves,
maintenance and insurance.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Accidents are rare, but when they do happen, the insurance agency
analyzes video footage via a machine-learning trained bot and
automatically gives the victim in the accident the appropriate
payment.</p>
<p>Except it’s not actually an insurance agency - it’s another smart
contract that pools together the funds of a multitude of owners and
charges people the exact expected value of car insurance, taking no
profit.</p>
<p>The near exact probability of accidents is known because every
accident that has ever happened is recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p>You head off to your company headquarters to work for the day.</p>
Except your work isn’t really work - it’s all voluntary because the
blockchain ensures a universal basic income for everyone, and you’re a
climate scientist primarily because you want to help push the boundaries
of human knowledge.

  style="width:45%" />

<p>Your company isn’t really a company either - it’s a decentralized
autonomous organization consisting of individuals from around the world
who voluntarily signed up, receive compensation and pay raises based off
the quantity and quality of their research findings as determined by a
worldwide oracle network, and who can exit their contract at any
time.</p>
Your company itself receives revenue over time as measured by the net
benefit to society your research brings.

<p>Your latest research provides strong evidence that the efforts to
reduce climate change have not been drastic enough, and that we are
heading towards potentially catastrophic levels of greenhouse gasses
unless we switch over 100% to renewable energies.</p>
<p>Your findings, based on publicly accessible data and analysis on the
blockchain, are presented to experts in the field, based on the quality
of their published research on the blockchain.</p>
A global democratic DAO decides this issue is important enough to
provide further incentives for countries to meet their new carbon
emission targets.

<p>Thanks to the fair democracy enabled by the DAO, the planet is saved
and we can all continue with a stable and secure future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what happens if not everything turns out well?</p>
<p>In this world, everything is on the blockchain… including a global
reputation score for everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>Someone is nice to you, you can upvote their reputation.</p>
<p>If they’re mean to you, you can downvote them, encouraging a society
full of kind and compassionate people like yourself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Evil Eve is jealous of your popularity.</p>
<p>Eve then realizes that decentralized reputation isn’t Sybil resistant
and launches a slander attack on you.</p>
<p>For the rest of your life, everyone you ever come in contact with is
immediately notified that the seemingly unconnected users Eve_001,
Eve_002, all the way to Eve_666 all believe you’re a criminal, and you
fail to secure a job for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>At least you have your universal basic income and savings to fall
back on, right?</p>
<p>- ahh, you remember you haven’t collected your payment this
month.</p>
<p>When you open up the payment portal, you find that your money is
gone!</p>
<p>Oh no! Your private keys must have been compromised.</p>
<p>You remember now that you never got around to using cold storage and
instead continued using an online hot wallet which got hacked.</p>
<p>Because there’s no central organization to recover your private keys
as keeping your keys safe is common sense nowadays, you now have to
figure out how to survive on your own.</p>
<p>Hungry and desperate, you go to your local cashier-less supermarket
and steal some food.</p>
<p>You order your ride home, but once in the car you realize something
is amiss.</p>
<p>The car is not taking your home; in fact, it is taking you towards
the local jail!</p>
<p>Once there, you plead with the police officers.</p>
<p>However, when they see your poor reputation score, they instantly
dismiss you and throw you into prison.</p>
<p>While in prison, you see the breaking news that Amazon owns 51% of
the government DAO.</p>
<p>It turns out the DAO holders realized they could make more profit by
selling their tokens given a bribe rather than upholding a decent
democracy.</p>
<p>With their new powers, Amazon proposes that they can increase the
efficiency of the blockchain by hosting all the data on their
centralized Amazon Web Services for free.</p>
<p>Despite warnings from Blockchain at Berkeley, the people are in
support of having a faster and cheaper blockchain service, so the
transition is made.</p>
<p>Amazon’s centralized blockchain works great, and everyone’s smart
contracts are running smoothly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a bug is discovered, it can be fixed without having
to disrupt the whole network.</p>
<p>The new blockchain is also able to reverse fraudulent transactions
and intervene whenever there is suspicious activity.</p>
<p>For now, everyone’s happy with their centralized blockchain solution,
forgetting the ancient words of the Cypherpunk Manifesto.</p>
<p>Over time, Amazon sets up a security standard which anyone using
their service must adhere to in order to gain access.</p>
<p>Eventually, the standards become stricter and more arbitrary to the
point where it is apparent that the only people who are able to use the
blockchain are Amazon and its customers.</p>
<p>A grassroots movement opposing this system begins, encouraging people
not to use this centralized ‘blockchain’ and instead to support local
businesses.</p>
<p>However, it’s too late, all other businesses have already been
eliminated.</p>
<p>Everyone is reliant on Universal Basic Income and as this gets
reduced over time, the people have no choice but to spend their lives
being a slave to Amazon.</p>

<h3>Intro: Get Involved</h3>

<p>Blockchain Fundamentals was designed to give you a brief survey into
the field of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and related technologies.</p>
<p>By now, you have much more knowledge about blockchain than your
average Joe.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you can have an intellectual conversation with someone who
is seasoned in the field – and thrive.</p>
<p>The last section was on a theoretical blockchain powered future.</p>
<p>This section will be on YOUR blockchain powered future.</p>
<p>There is so much you could be doing to get further involved in the
space.</p>
<p>This section will be a quick roadmap explaining the opportunities in
the field.</p>

<h3>Getting Involved</h3>

<p>About getting involved in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>There’s not much to say, other than that there’s been a surge in the
number of blockchain jobs.</p>
<p>And that’s expected for a space that’s so new.</p>
<p>There’s a huge shortage of blockchain talent right now, especially
good talent.</p>
<p>Here is just a small subset of the largest companies looking to hire
blockchain experts.</p>
<p>These companies are looking for developers, researchers, marketers,
accountants, financial consultants, and much, much more.</p>
<p>The knowledge you’ve gained and the skills you’ve honed throughout
this course have prepared you at a fundamental level to follow any of
these paths.</p>
<p>Perhaps you want to join a startup and work at the forefront of
cutting edge blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Here are just a couple of some of the top startups in the area.</p>
<p>Outside of professional development, there are plenty of ways to
surround yourself with equally enthusiastic individuals in the
blockchain community.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you should know that the community lives and
breathes on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter is an immensely useful resource for directly reaching out to
anyone in the space with questions or ideas.</p>
<p>Various meetups for blockchain and crypto enthusiasts occur
regularly, all over the world.</p>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you’re free to use any of
Blockchain at Berkeley’s public resources.</p>
<p>This edX course is one.</p>
<p>We also have a public slack and discord.</p>
<p>The blockchain space is constantly evolving, and joining a community
of peers is perhaps the best way to keep up with the industry’s rapid
changes.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>The most accessible resources for getting more involved in the
blockchain space can be found right here in edX. The goal of both of our
courses in the Blockchain Fundamentals program was to provide students
with a baseline understanding of blockchain – its design and context –
surmounting the blockchain space’s traditionally high learning curve.
The discussion boards have been a great place for students to not only
get their questions and concerns resolved, but also to meet and network
with other students. For example, some students have set up mailing
lists, chat rooms, and even organized meetups – all from the discussion
boards. Such student-created resources are not official resources, but
we encourage decentralization!</p>
<p>We have ported all of our educational materials over to our <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqeIoMMTKl9PK9O8BcEpNhQ">Blockchain
Fundamentals edX YouTube channel</a> , for your quick reference in the
future. Feel free to share video links with your friends and peers.</p>
<p>Now that you have finished this course, here are a list of other
Blockchain at Berkeley resources. Some of you may have discovered these

<p>We’ll also open up a discussion topic below, under ‘Student Resources’, as 
a central place where you can post useful resources for other students. If you 
recently read, watched, experienced, etc. anything related to the blockchain 
space in general, please contribute to our course community and share in the 
discussion boards!</p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of all of our lovely course staff, I’d like to thank you, for 
taking CS198.2x, Blockchain Technology.df</p>
<p>This formally marks the end of the Blockchain Fundamentals curriculum.</p>
<p>If you’ve been with us since the first course, thanks for staying along for 
the ride.</p>
<p>If you joined us with previous knowledge about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies 
– the topic of the first course – we hope you took out of this course much more 
than you thought.</p>
<p>In either case, we hope you enjoyed taking this class as much as we enjoyed 
teaching it.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more, there’s still a great deal of complexity and 
innovation left to explore, so I challenge you to get more involved in the 
blockchain space.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best on the rest of your blockchain journey!</p>
<p>The end…</p>
